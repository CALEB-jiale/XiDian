00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
This brings us to the end of the six weeks
course. I had a lot of fun teaching this

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,566
course and I hope you enjoyed it too. I
really love this material and I always

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:11,232
enjoy teaching it. Before we say our
farewells, please do a quick review of the

4
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:15,166
topics that we discussed and see what's
left to cover. So here's a brief diagram

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,411
of the primitive that we discussed in the
class. If you remember in week one we

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,762
started off by discussing pseudorandom
generators and stream ciphers. In week two

7
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:28,168
we talked about block ciphers and we said
that the right way to think about block

8
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:32,734
cipher is as pseudorandom permutations and
pseudorandom functions. We said that using

9
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:37,301
counter mode we can convert a block cipher
into a PRG. And we said that using the GGM

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:41,375
construction. We can construct block
ciphers from pseudorandom generators. Then

11
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,271
in week three, we talked about data
integrity. In particular, we talked about

12
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,906
MACs and we looked at various
constructions of MACs from pseudorandom

13
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,749
functions like the CMAC, the HMAC, the
PMAC constructions and so on. We also

14
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:57,164
discussed collision resistance and we said
that collision resistance can be used for

15
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:01,111
data integrity where one has access to
read-only memory. Basically, you would

16
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,110
hash the data using a collision resistance
hash function; write the hash into

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,369
read-only memory. And then later, when you
want to verify authenticity of your data,

18
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,633
you just compare its hash to whatever is
written in read-only memory. Then in week 4

19
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:17,943
we talked about how to combine integrity
and confidentiality, in particular we

20
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:22,640
kinda talk about to combine encryption and
MACs to build what we called Authenticated

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,951
Encryption and I told you that really in
practice, the only foremost Symmetric

22
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:31,151
Encryption that you're allowed to use is
Authenticated Encryption. Basically,

23
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:35,461
encryption that's only secure against
eavesdropping attacks is not generally

24
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,827
secure, you must always also guard against
tampering and as a result, you should only

25
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:44,388
be using Authenticated Encryption modes to
do Symmetric Encryption. So that was the

26
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:48,574
end of week four. And then for weeks five
and six, we switched topics and talked

27
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:52,759
about key exchange and public key encryption.
In particular, in week five we talked

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,247
about Trapdoor Functions and the
Diffie-Hellman Protocol [within??] the

29
00:01:56,247 --> 00:02:00,594
Mathematics that are necessary to explain
how those things work. And then in week

30
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:05,048
six we talked about how public key encryption
can be built from trapdoor functions and,

31
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:09,090
the Diffie-Hellman Protocol. I wanna
emphasize that the key exchange protocols

32
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,573
that we saw in week five are only secure
against eavesdropping and should never be

33
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:18,002
used in practice. In fact in week eight
we're gonna see authenticated key exchange

34
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:22,485
protocols and those are the ones that are
actually used in the wild for example in

35
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:26,698
SSL and other protocols like that. But,
the ones that we saw in week five should

36
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:31,018
never actually be deployed in the real
world. The only reason we looked at those

37
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:35,123
simple key exchange mechanisms was as
motivation for trapdoor functions and

38
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:39,064
Diffie-Hellman groups. Now as you know there
are four more weeks to the full crypto

39
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:42,934
course which we're gonna do at a later
time. In week seven we're gonna talk about

40
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,996
digital signatures and how to authenticate
data in a way that anyone can verify that

41
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:50,866
the data is authentic. Then we're gonna
talk about authenticated key exchanges as

42
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,640
I said then we're gonna talk about user
authentication, how to manage passwords,

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,319
one time passwords, challenge-response
protocols. Then we'll talk about various

44
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,190
privacy mechanisms. How to authenticate
yourself without revealing where you are,

45
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,284
How to sign in a way it doesn't reveal who
you are and so on and so forth. And in this part

46
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:10,041
of the building blocks for some of these
mechanisms, actually, we'll talk about

47
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,992
zero-knowledge protocols which is kind of
a general purpose tool that's used very

48
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:17,821
widely in cryptography. But let's just say
that crypto goes way beyond this core

49
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:21,687
topics and in fact, there are many, many
more topics that I would love to tell you

50
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:25,554
about if there was enough time. So I made
this kind of a short list here and this isn't

51
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:29,469
even an exhaustive list. There are many
other things that I would like to tell you

52
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:33,383
about and so if there's enough demand, I
might even run an advanced crypto class

53
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:37,107
which is usually what I do for graduate
students which would cover these more

54
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:40,831
advanced topics but that would actually
take place sometime next year so stay

55
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:44,890
tuned and I will send announcements on
when that's coming. So my final words of

56
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,427
course remember my main message from this
class. And that crypto is a tremendous

57
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:53,298
tool but you should always be careful when
you use it. If you implement crypto

58
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:56,821
incorrectly, the system will work
perfectly fine. It would be no way to

59
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:00,791
tell that anything is wrong except when
attacker is trying to attack the system,

60
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,571
it might be easily breakable. And so
crypto is one of these things where a

61
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:08,317
little bit of knowledge is quite
dangerous. It's quite important to make

62
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:12,531
sure you get the implementation correctly
and one way to do that is to make sure

63
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:16,850
that always other people review your code
and your designs to find any bugs in the

64
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,116
crypto implementation or even more general
bugs in the system design. And finally

65
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:25,313
I'll leave you with these parting words, that you should never ever invent your own

66
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:29,454
ciphers or your own modes and you should
never even implement your own ciphers or

67
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:33,242
your own modes. Try to stick to the
standards as much as possible. Try to

68
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:37,535
stick to standard implementations of those
algorithms as much as possible and if you

69
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:41,778
have to deviate from that, then just make
sure there's sufficient third party review

70
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:46,557
of what you've done. Okay, so I will
say my farewell here. And let me say that

71
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:50,956
the final exam will be made available on
week seven, basically, a week after the

72
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:55,688
week six lectures become public. The final
exam will cover material for all six weeks

73
00:04:55,688 --> 00:05:00,309
and it'll pretty much be the same format
as the problem sets. I hope everybody will

74
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:04,764
do well in the exam and we will send
certificates once all those course work is

75
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:09,348
complete and I hope to see you in the next
iteration of this course whenever that's

76
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:12,992
made available. So farewell, and as
always, please submit your comments and

77
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:16,986
suggestions on the forum. I read all of
your posts and they're very, very helpful

78
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:19,582
in improving the course. Hope to see you
in the fall.
