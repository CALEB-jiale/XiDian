1
00:00:00,365 --> 00:00:02,577
In the previous lecture, we looked at a public key

2
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:04,714
encryption system that is built from the RSA,

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,733
or more generally from trapdoors functions.

4
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,986
In this lecture, we are going to look at public key encryption

5
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:12,516
schemes that are build from the Diffie-Hellman protocol.

6
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:14,327
So, first recall that a public key encryption system is

7
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:16,370
made up of three algorithms. There is a key

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,017
generation algorithm that I will denote by Gen,

9
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:20,968
that basically generates a public key and a

10
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,057
secret key. And then there are two algorithms: E

11
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:27,237
and D that encrypt and decrypt. And the point is

12
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:29,467
the encryption algorithm encrypts using the

13
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,788
public key and the decryption algorithm decrypts

14
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:35,736
using the secret key. The physical world analogy for

15
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,600
public key encryption is a locked box, where anyone

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,609
can put a message inside the box and then lock the

17
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,200
box, that corresponds to the public key and then

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,733
no one can open this box, except the person who has

19
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,736
the secret key, that has the key can put it in the

20
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:52,872
lock, unlock the box and the recover the message in

21
00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:56,912
the box. Now, in the previous lecture, we looked at

22
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:59,141
a number of applications for public key encryption.

23
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,928
In particular, we looked at the key exchange

24
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,878
application, in fact, this is how public key encryption

25
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:06,107
is used in SSL, where the server sends its public

26
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,667
key to the browser, the browser chooses a secret

27
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:11,434
and then encrypts the secret using the server's

28
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,538
public key, sends it back to the server, the

29
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,860
server decrypts and now both the browser and the

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,042
server have a common secret that they can then

31
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:20,600
use to encrypt data, going back and forth, between

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,383
them. So, in the interactive settings, such as in a

33
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,983
networking protocol, public key encryption would

34
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:28,667
primarily be used for setting up shared symmetric key

35
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,999
which the two parties can then use to exchange

36
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,228
information. However, there are many settings

37
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:35,922
where interaction is simply not possible and then

38
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:38,429
public key encryption is directly used to encrypt

39
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:41,587
messages. One example of this is secure email.

40
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:44,002
The email system in some sense is designed to be non-

41
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:46,696
interactive, in the sense that the sender sends an

42
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:49,250
email, the email travels from relay to relay, to

43
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,067
relay, until it finally arrives at the destination

44
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:54,133
and the destination should be able to decrypt,

45
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,262
without interacting with the sender at that point.

46
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:57,731
That can be done basically, by the sender

47
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,467
encrypting the message using the recipient's public

48
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:04,250
key. The ciphertext would travel along the SMTP chain

49
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,990
until it reaches the recipient. The recipient would

50
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,544
use a secret key and recover the original sent

51
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:13,074
message. However, there are many other cases

52
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:15,227
where interaction is not possible and I want to show

53
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:17,857
you two such cases. The first example is

54
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:20,922
file systems. And in fact, public key encryption is a

55
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:23,277
good way to manage file sharing, in an encrypted file

56
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,934
system. So, let me show you what I mean

57
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:27,379
by that. So, imagine we have our friend Bob

58
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,792
here, who wants to store an encrypted file on some

59
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,603
storage server. So, he will go ahead and write the

60
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:34,533
encrypted file to the storage server. What he

61
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,867
actually writes in the server is basically the

62
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:40,334
following: he will generate a random file encryption key, we

63
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,667
will call it 'K sub F' and then he will use the

64
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,674
symmetric encryption system to encrypt the file

65
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:49,715
using the key 'K sub F'. Then, he will encrypt the

66
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:52,780
key 'K sub F', using his own public key. So public key

67
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,402
of Bob. This will give Bob access to the file at a later

68
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:59,188
time, right. Using his secret key, Bob can decrypt

69
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:02,532
this header, recover 'K sub F'. Then he will

70
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:04,933
decrypt the actual encrypted file and recover the

71
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,523
plaintext file. So, decryption will work in two steps.

72
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:11,216
However, Bob now wants also to give access to

73
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:13,678
Alice, to this file. What he will do is, he will go

74
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:16,400
ahead and in addition he will also include in the

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,529
file header, an encyption of 'K sub F' under Alice's

76
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:22,315
public key. OK. So, notice that there was no

77
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:24,916
interaction here. All that Bob knows is Alice's public

78
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,192
key and yet he was able to the make the file

79
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,699
accesible to Alice at a later time.

80
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,767
So, now Bob disappears and then Alice

81
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:35,272
comes and accesses the disk at a later time.

82
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:37,966
She will read the ciphertext, decrypt  her part of

83
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:41,542
the header, recover Kf and then she can decrypt

84
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:44,533
the symmetrically encrypted file and recover the

85
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,207
actual file contents. Ok, so you can see that without

86
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,576
any interaction, Bob was able to write to the file

87
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:55,195
system and enable Alice to access the file, as well.

88
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,825
Again, at the time that Alice was reading the file, there is no

89
00:03:57,825 --> 00:04:00,443
interaction with Bob, because maybe Bob is already

90
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:02,267
inaccesible and yet Alice can still read the file

91
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:04,754
recovered by herself.

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,933
So, another example of a non-interactive

93
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,667
application of public key encryption is what's called

94
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,003
key escrow. Now, key escrow may actually sound

95
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,186
like a bad thing but in fact it is a mandatory

96
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:18,740
feature in corporate environments. So, the idea

97
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,573
here is this. So imagine Bob writes data to a

98
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:25,733
disk and then later Bob becomes inaccesible.

99
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,600
Maybe Bob is fired. Maybe Bob is out sick.

100
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,675
And somehow the company needs to have access to

101
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:33,667
Bob's files. So having Bob be the only one

102
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,133
able to decrypt these files is simply unacceptable in

103
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:38,198
corporate settings. The corporation might need

104
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:41,635
access to those files. So, the question is what to do.

105
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:43,667
And the answer is to introduce this entity called

106
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,296
a key escrow service. The way the system then

107
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:48,322
would work is as follows:

108
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,248
Basically, when Bob writes his file to disk, his

109
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:54,406
system, as it's writing the file to this shared

110
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:56,800
storage medium, what it would do of course, as before,

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,186
it would encrypt the file using the file encryption key Kf.

112
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:04,467
It would encrypt Kf using Bob's public key, but it would

113
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:08,200
also encrypt Kf using an escrow service. So here,

114
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,400
the escrow service is completely offline. We never

115
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,329
talk to it unless we actually need its services.

116
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,000
As Bob is writing the file, all he does is he simply writes

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,366
the encryption of Kf under the escrow authority's

118
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:23,477
public key into the file header. Now, later Bob

119
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:26,067
disappears and now the company needs to recover

120
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,200
Bob's file. What does it do? Well, at this point it would

121
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,536
contact the escrow service. The escrow service

122
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,400
would read this part of the header, use its secret

123
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,333
key to decrypt the header and recover Kf and then use Kf

124
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,802
to decrypt the actual file.

125
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:42,007
Ok. So, in this way again you notice that  the escrow service was

126
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,607
completely offline. There was no interaction with the

127
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:47,600
escrow service until the point at which the escrow

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,737
services were actually needed. And again, you can

129
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:53,133
see that this is a very clean and elegant application

130
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,333
of public key encryption. So, as I said in the

131
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,867
previous lecture, we saw constructions for public

132
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:01,333
key encryption based on trapdoor functions.

133
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,667
In particular, we look at RSA. We looked at the

134
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,867
generic construction we called ISO standard.

135
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:09,467
We looked at constructions like OAEP+ and so on and so forth.

136
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,887
In this lecture, we are going to look at public key

137
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,467
constructions from the Diffie-Hellman protocol.

138
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,800
This is another family of public key systems and

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,508
I am going to show you how they work. These public

140
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:21,133
key systems are generally called ElGamal public key

141
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:24,200
encryption schemes. Taher ElGamal was actually Marty

142
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,635
Hellman's student. He came up with this ElGamal

143
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:30,165
encryption system as part of his PhD thesis.

144
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,400
And, in fact, ElGamal encryption, for historical

145
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,800
reasons, is used in an email encryption system called GPG,

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,360
the GNU Privacy Guard. As usual, when we

147
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,333
construct public key encryption systems, our goal is

148
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,050
to build systems that have chosen ciphertext security,

149
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,667
so that they are secure both against eavesdropping

150
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,599
and tampering attacks. So, before I show you the ElGamal

151
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,333
system let's do a very brief review of the Diffie-Hellman

152
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,133
protocol. So, in my description here, I am going

153
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,679
to abstract a little bit from the version that we saw last

154
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,467
week. In fact, I just going to use the concept

155
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,933
of a finite cyclic group. In fact, we have an arbitrary finite

156
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,131
cyclic group, for example, it could be the group (Zp) star,

157
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:10,521
but it could also be the points of an elliptic curve.

158
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,533
And as I mentioned, there are some benefits to doing

159
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,467
Diffie-Hellman over an elliptic curve. But, for simplicity,

160
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,000
I am just going to refer to G as an abstract finite

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
cyclic group, but in your heads you should be

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,456
thinking G is the group (Zp) and let's suppose

163
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:25,467
that the group has order n for some integer n.

164
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,667
Now, we are going to fix a generator g of this group

165
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,933
and all this means, is basically, if you look at the

166
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,905
successive powers of g, that basically you get

167
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:35,200
all the elements in the group G. You notice,

168
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,667
because the group has order n, we know that

169
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,133
g to the power of n is equal to 1. And, therefore

170
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:44,053
there is no reason to go beyond the n-1st power

171
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:48,036
of g. g to the n is equal to 1 so that we just wrap around.

172
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,600
Ok. So, we have this cyclic group G. We have this

173
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,453
generator whose powers gave us all the elements of

174
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,565
G, and now let me remind you how the Diffie-Hellman

175
00:07:57,565 --> 00:08:00,133
protocol works. Basically, what Alice does is she  chooses a

176
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,133
random a. She computes g to the a and sends it

177
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:06,621
over to Bob. Bob chooses a random b. Let's see who

178
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:10,905
remembers. What does Bob send over to Alice?

179
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:15,398
So, Bob sends over to Alice g to the b and of

180
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:18,370
course I should remind you that both g to the a and

181
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,867
g to the b are just elements in this group G. Now,

182
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,133
they can derive the shared secret, If you remember,

183
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:27,667
the shared secret is g to the ab, and these equalities

184
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,467
here shows that both sides can actually compute

185
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:33,133
the shared secret given the values at their disposal.

186
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,800
So, Alice for example, has B and she has a, and

187
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,667
so raising B to the power of a, gives her the shared

188
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,776
secret. The attacker, of course, the poor attacker

189
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:46,512
he gets to see A and B and his goal is now,

190
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:49,438
of course, he also gets to see the generated g, and

191
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:52,333
his goal now is to compute g to the ab. But, we said that

192
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,600
this is believed to be a hard problem. Given g, g to the a,

193
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,067
and g to the b, in a group like  Zp<i>, computing g to </i>

194
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:03,533
the ab is difficult. So, now let's see how to convert to

195
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,467
the Diffie-Hellman protocol into an actual public key

196
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:08,533
system. As I said, this was a brilliant idea due to

197
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,133
Taher ElGamal. So, as before, we are going to fix our

198
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,305
cyclic group G and a generator g inside of G.

199
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:19,400
Now, here I wrote the Diffie-Hellman protocol again,

200
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
except now we are going to assume that these guys

201
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,533
are separated in time. These two steps do not have

202
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:28,133
to occur simultaneously; they could actually take place

203
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,800
at quite different times. The first step of the Diffie-Hellman

204
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,578
protocol is what we are going to view as key

205
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,533
generation. That is the public key is going to be

206
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,200
this capital A  and the secret key is simply going to

207
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,200
be the little a. So, you notice of course that

208
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,667
extracting the secret key from the public key,

209
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,333
namely extracting the little a from capital A is a

210
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,132
discrete log problem. So, that recovering a secret

211
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:55,787
key is actually difficult. Ok, now this gives us our public key.

212
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:57,805
So, now at a later time Bob wants to encrypt a

213
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,083
message to Alice, encrypted using her public key.

214
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,161
So how does Bob encrypt? Well, what he is going to do is

215
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:06,400
he's going to compute his contribution to the Diffie-Hellman

216
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,990
protocol. Namely, he is going to send over g to the

217
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,467
little b. Of course, he is going to choose this little b

218
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,005
at random and now he is going to compute by

219
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:16,133
himself the shared secret. So, he is going to

220
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:20,276
compute by himself g to the ab. From this g to the ab

221
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:23,249
he is going to derive a symmetric key for a

222
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,282
symmetric encryption system and then he is going to

223
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:27,844
encrypt the message m using this symmetric key

224
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,306
that he just derived. And that is the pair he is going to

225
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,200
send. So, he is going to send over his contribution

226
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,933
to the Diffie-Hellman protocol plus the symmetric

227
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:38,067
encryption of the message m that he wants to send

228
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,733
over to Alice. Ok, so you can see basically, we are

229
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,933
doing the exact same thing as we would do in the Diffie-Hellman

230
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:48,046
protocol except now we, Bob directly immediately is using

231
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:51,067
his Diffie-Hellman secret to encrypt the message  that he

232
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,600
wants to send over to Alice.

233
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
Now, what does Alice do to decrypt?

234
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,733
Basically, she is going also to compute the

235
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,615
Diffie-Hellman secret. Remember, that now she just

236
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,600
received Bob's contribution to the Diffie-Hellman

237
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,400
protocol and she has her secret key a. So, she can

238
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,733
compute also the Diffie-Hellman secret, namely

239
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,400
g to the ab, from which she is going to derive the

240
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,055
symmetric encryption key k. And then, she is going

241
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,800
to decrypt the message to recover the actual

242
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,584
plaintext. Ok, so that is the intuition for how we

243
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:20,461
convert the Diffie-Hellman protocol into a public key

244
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,318
system. By the way, this was kind of an interesting

245
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:25,400
development at the time that it came out,  partially

246
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,000
because, you notice this is a randomized encryption scheme.

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,188
So, every time Bob encrypts a message, it is

248
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:34,133
required that he choose a new random b and

249
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:38,015
encrypt the message using this new random b.

250
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,364
So, let's see the ElGamal system,  actually in more

251
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:42,708
detail. So, now actually let's  view it as an actual

252
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,800
public key encryption system. Namely, algorithm Gen,

253
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,333
algorithm E and algorithm D.

254
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,533
So, as usual, we are going to fix our finite cyclic

255
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:53,133
group of order n. Another ingredient that we are going

256
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,600
to need is a symmetric encryption system. So, I am

257
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,402
going to refer to it as E sub s, and D sub s. These are the

258
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:00,651
encryption and decryption algorithms of a symmetric

259
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:02,767
encryption system that happens to provide

260
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,077
authenticated encryption. And, the key space for

261
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:08,667
this system is capital K. And, then we are also going

262
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:11,859
to need a hash function that maps pairs of elements

263
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,533
in the group, namely elements in G squared into

264
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,200
the key space. Now, here is how the public key

265
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,467
encryption system works. So, I have to describe

266
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:22,133
three algorithms. Algorithm that generates the

267
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,200
public key and the secret key, and then the  encryption

268
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,600
and decryption algorithms. So, the key generation

269
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,733
algorithm works as follows: All we do is basically,

270
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,600
build up Alice's contribution to the Diffie-Hellman

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,133
protocol. What we are going to do is going to choose a

272
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:37,662
random generator g in G and then we are going to

273
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:39,800
choose a random exponent a. The secret key is

274
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,267
going to be a and then the public key is going to be

275
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:45,867
the generator g and Alice's contribution to the

276
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,262
Diffie-Hellman protocol. The reason, by the way,

277
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,090
we don't use a fix generator, is because it

278
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,662
allows us to somewhat use a weaker assumption,

279
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:54,933
improving security. And, so it is actually better to

280
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,845
choose a random generator every time. It is easy

281
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,000
enough to choose a random generator. All we do, is we

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,533
take the generator that we started with and then we

283
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,667
raise it to some power that is relatively prime to n.

284
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,600
That will give us another generator. A random

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
generator of the group capital G. Ok. So, you can

286
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,799
see here that again the public key is simply Alice's

287
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,000
contribution to the Diffie-Hellman protocol. And, the

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,667
secret key is the random a that she chose. Now, how

289
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,400
do we encrypt and decrypt? Well, when Bob wants

290
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,067
to encrypt the message, he is going to use the

291
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,467
public key. Remember, it consists of  g and h.

292
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:28,533
Here, he wants to encrypt a message m.

293
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,533
So, here is what he is going to do. So, he is going

294
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,768
to choose his contribution to the Diffie-Hellman protocol.

295
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,200
So, this is the secret b that he would normally

296
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,267
choose in Diffie-Hellman. And, now he is going to

297
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:40,667
compute g to the b, which is actually his message,

298
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,600
that gets send to Alice in the Diffie-Hellman protocol.

299
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,050
He is going to compute the Diffie-Hellman secret,

300
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,000
that's h to the b. If you remember, h was g to the a,

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
therefore, this value here is really g to the ab.

302
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,067
That's the Diffie-Hellman secret. That is the one thing that

303
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,600
the attacker doesn't actually know. Next, he is going

304
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,067
to compute a symmetric key by basically hashing

305
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:02,333
this pair u comma v. So, u, of course, is something

306
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,102
that the attacker is going to know because that is

307
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:06,733
going to be sent as part of the ciphertext. But v, the

308
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:09,667
attacker isn't going to know. Again, for the proof of

309
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:13,267
security, actually it helps to hash both u and v. So, we

310
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,667
hash both of them together. Although, strictly speaking

311
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,600
we just needed to hash v, because v is the only value

312
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
that the attacker doesn't know. The attacker

313
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,737
already knows u, because that's going to be part of the data

314
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,000
that's sent on the network. So, anyhow, so Bob derives

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,933
this symmetric key k, by hashing u and v. Then, he

316
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,867
goes ahead and encrypts the message using the

317
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:33,933
symmetric key k and finally he outputs his

318
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,733
contribution to the Diffie-Hellman protocol.

319
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,867
The value u and then the symmetric ciphertext that

320
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:41,223
directly encrypts the message m.

321
00:14:41,223 --> 00:14:43,841
That's it. So, the ciphertext consists of these two

322
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,764
parts and that is the thing that gets sent over the

323
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:48,098
network. Let's see, how does Alice decrypt now.

324
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:50,800
So, she is going to use her secret key a to decrypt

325
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
and she receives here, Bob's contribution to the

326
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,533
Diffie-Hellman protocol plus the symmetric

327
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:59,000
encryption of the message that Bob sent.

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,800
What she will do is she'll compute herself the Diffie-Hellman

329
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,267
secret. If you remember, u to the a is simply g to the b

330
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:07,933
to the a. Which is g to the ab. So, here Alice

331
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:11,467
computed the Diffie-Hellman secret. And, now let me

332
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:14,467
ask you, how does she derive the symmetric key k

333
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,867
given the Diffie-Hellman secret, g to the ab and the

334
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,103
ciphertext that she was given?

335
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,933
Well, what she will do, is simply again, now she has

336
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:27,267
u from the ciphertext and she has v, because she just

337
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,667
computed it herself. So, now she can rederive the

338
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,800
symmetric encryption key  by hashing u and v

339
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,333
together to get the symmetric encryption key and

340
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,667
then she just decrypts the ciphertext to get the

341
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,600
actual plaintext. OK, so that's it. That is the whole

342
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,333
encryption and decryption algorithm. In a picture,

343
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,493
the way the ciphertext would look, is also

344
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:47,667
as kind of what we saw in the last lecture. Basically,

345
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,323
there would be a short header that contains u.

346
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:53,467
Which as you recall, is g to the b. And, then the rest of the

347
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,800
ciphertext would be the encryption of the message

348
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,441
that is being sent, under the symmetric key k.

349
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:04,000
And, then to decrypt, Alice would use this header

350
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,533
to derive the Diffie-Hellman secret from which she

351
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,735
will derive k and then decrypts the body, to get the

352
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,336
original plaintext. By the way, I should note that

353
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:14,667
the way I describe this system here, is actually not

354
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,544
how ElGamal described it originally, this is

355
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,775
in some sense a modern view about the ElGamal

356
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,809
encryption, but it is pretty much equivalent to how

357
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:25,600
ElGamal viewed it. So, now let's look at the

358
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,379
performance of ElGamal. So, here what I wrote

359
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,800
is the, kind of the time intensive steps of  ElGamal

360
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,400
encryption. Namely, during encryption, there are

361
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,133
these two exponentiations in the group G.

362
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,067
Exponentiation, remember is a cubic time algorithm

363
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,867
using the repeated squaring algorithm. And, as a

364
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:43,467
result, it is fairly time intensive. When I say, time

365
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,819
intensive, I mean, that on a modern processor it would

366
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:47,200
take a few milliseconds to compute these

367
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,667
exponentiations and during decryption, basically,

368
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,353
the decryptor computes one exponentiation,

369
00:16:52,353 --> 00:16:54,272
namely, u to the a. This is the bottleneck during

370
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:57,667
decryption. Ok, so you would think that encryption

371
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,067
actually is, takes twice as long as decryption, because

372
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,400
encryption requires two exponentiations, while

373
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,333
decryption requires only one. It turns out, that

374
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,133
is not entirely accurate because, you notice that the exponentiation

375
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,533
during decryption is done to a variable basis.

376
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:14,667
Namely, u changes every time. Whereas during

377
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:18,267
encryption, the basis is fixed: g and h are derived

378
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,067
from the public key and are fixed forever.

379
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,000
So, in fact, in turns out that if you want to do

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,667
exponentiation to a fixed basis, you can do a lot of

381
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:28,600
precomputation. In particular, you can do all the

382
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,067
squaring steps in the repeated squaring algorithm

383
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,534
offline. So, here what you would do, you would

384
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,733
compute all powers of 2 of g. So, you would

385
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,267
compute g, g squared, g to the fourth, g to the

386
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,872
eighth, go to the sixteenth, g to the thirty two, and so

387
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:44,565
on and so forth. These are all the squaring steps of

388
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,333
the repeated squaring algorithm you would do offline.

389
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,482
The same thing for h. And, then when it comes time to

390
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:52,600
actually do the real exponentiation all you need to do is just do the

391
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,733
multiplications, to accumulate these powers of 2 into the

392
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,533
exponent b, that you're trying to compute.

393
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,267
So, if you think about it, this can actually speed up

394
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:03,133
exponentiation by a factor of 3. In fact, it would

395
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,533
speed up it even more if you allow me to store even

396
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:09,133
larger tables. This is called a windowed exponentiation.

397
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:12,133
But, regardless, if you allow the encryptor to

398
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,937
store large tables that are derived from the public

399
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:17,400
key, then in fact encryption is not going to be

400
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,267
slower than decryption. In fact, encryption will be

401
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,867
faster than decryption. But, again, this requires that

402
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:25,467
the encryptor to precompute these large tables

403
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:28,126
and store them around. So, if all the encryptor is

404
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:30,600
doing, is just constantly encrypting to a single

405
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,400
recipient, that can be done actually fairly fast using these

406
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,067
precomputed tables. If the encryptor, for every

407
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,800
message is encrypting to a different recipient, for

408
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,933
example, if every time you send an email, you send

409
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:44,612
an email to a different recipient, then, in fact, the

410
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:47,671
encryption will be twice as slow as decryption.

411
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:51,200
So, this is a good trick to keep in mind. In fact, most

412
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,467
cryptolibraries don't do this. So, if you see that you

413
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,000
are always encrypting to the same public key and

414
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,333
for some reason your encryption process takes a

415
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,400
lot of time, it's a bottleneck for you, keep in mind

416
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,021
that you can actually really speed things up

417
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,333
using precomputation.

418
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,200
Of couse, if encryption is a bottleneck for you, you

419
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,133
might as well be using RSA, where an RSA encryption

420
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:14,067
is really fast. Ok, so that is the end of our

421
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:16,133
description of ElGamal encryption. Now, the next

422
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,800
question of course, is why is the system secure,

423
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,467
in particular, can we prove that it's chosen

424
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:24,133
ciphertext secure and more importantly, under what

425
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,267
assumptions can we prove that the system is

426
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:27,600
chosen ciphertext secure? So, we are going to

427
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,310
discuss that in the next segment.
