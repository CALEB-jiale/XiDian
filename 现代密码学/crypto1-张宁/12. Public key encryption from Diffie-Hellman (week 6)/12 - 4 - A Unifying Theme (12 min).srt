00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,076
This week, we saw two families of public
encryption systems. One family was built

2
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:08,204
from trapdoor functions, and particularly
RSA, and the other family was built from

3
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:12,078
the Diffie-Hellman protocol. In this last
segment, I wanna show you that both

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:16,065
families in fact follow from a more
general principle. The unifying theme is

5
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:20,671
what's called a one-way function. So what
is a one-way function? Well, we've already

6
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:24,995
seen this concept briefly before. But
basically, a function from, one set to

7
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:29,376
another, say, from X to Y is said to be
one way, if, in fact, there's an efficient

8
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:33,813
algorithm that allows us to evaluate the
function F. So anyone can evaluate the

9
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:38,306
function F at any point of their choice.
However, inverting the function F should

10
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:42,406
be difficult. That's what makes the
function one way. So what do I mean by

11
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:47,068
that? Well, you can think of the function
F as a function again mapping the set X to

12
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:52,165
the set Y. But it so happens in many
points in X could actually be mapped into

13
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:57,228
a single point in Y. Now when they say
that the function is difficult to invert,

14
00:00:57,228 --> 00:01:02,347
what I mean is that when I give you some
point inside of Y and I ask you find me

15
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:07,530
pre-image of this point, you won't be able
to point to any of these as a pre-image.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,838
In other words, no efficient algorithm can
find any point that is the inverse of the

17
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:17,958
given point Y. Now the way we say that
more precisely is that we say that for all

18
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:23,203
efficient algorithm A, if I chose a random
X in the set, capital X, and now I'm gonna

19
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:28,839
give f(x) to algorithm A. And then, what
I'm gonna ask algorithm A to do, is

20
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:34,774
basically produce a pre-image of the point
f(x). Well, what does it mean that A

21
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:41,030
produced a pre-image of the point f(x)? It
means that if I apply the function f to

22
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,180
the output of A, what I should get back
is, well, f(x). Let's think through this

23
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,428
one more time. So I chose a random point x
in Capital X. You know I give algorithm A

24
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:57,486
f(x). So I'm gonna give algorithm A this
point here. And now A is gonna produce

25
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:02,291
some points. So let's pretend that A
produces this point over here. And now I

26
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:07,349
wanna say that if I apply the function F
to this point here, that A produced, the

27
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,471
probability that I get the same point that
I started with is negligible. In other

28
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:17,558
words the probability that algorithm A
was able to produce one of these three points is, in

29
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:23,203
fact, negligible. All he can do is produce
some other point that maps into something

30
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:28,440
other than f(x), okay? So, again, all
this is trying to do is just capture the

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,814
fact that given f(x), it's hard to find
some pre-image of f(x). So here's some

32
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:38,119
easy examples of functions that are not
one-way. For example, the identity

33
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:42,955
function f(x) is equal to x is trivially
not one way because given f(x), I can

34
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:47,850
easily come up with an inverse of f(x),
namely x. Similarly the function that will

35
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,449
maps everything to zero is also not one
way. So in our picture, let the function

36
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:57,167
maps everything to zero simply looks as
follows. It takes all its points and maps

37
00:02:57,167 --> 00:03:02,133
them all to a single point. Well this
function is not one way because if I give

38
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:07,324
you this point in the image, it's trivial
to find the pre-image. Namely, just pick

39
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:12,579
any point in capital X, and there will be
a pre-image of zero. And so, f(x) equal

40
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:17,185
to zero is also not a one-way function.
And by the way, I didn't want to do it

41
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:21,337
here. But if I define one-way functions
more formally, then it turns out that

42
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:25,707
proving that one-way functions exist,
we'll have also proven that P is not equal

43
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:29,805
to NP. So, since we can't today, prove
that P is not equal to NP, basically we

44
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:34,230
can't prove that one-way functions exist.
And we just have to assume that they do.

45
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,305
So let's look at our first example of a
1-way function. Or at least a presumed

46
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:42,329
1-way function. And so we're gonna build
it from a pseudo random generator. And

47
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,559
suppose I have a function F from x to y
there is a secure pseudo random generator.

48
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,531
So the output of f s much larger than
the input. Remember, a pseudo-random

49
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,691
generator takes a small seed and expands
it into a much larger output. And for

50
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:58,590
example you can, you know, the pseudo
random generator maybe is built using

51
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,806
deterministic counter mode out of AES.
Well, it's fairly easy to see that if, in

52
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:06,541
fact, F is a secure pseudo random
generator, then F is in fact a one-way

53
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:10,604
function. So our first example of a
one-way function is directly built from a

54
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:14,820
pseudo random generator. This is actually
kind of a trivial proof, so let's prove

55
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,088
the contra positive. So suppose I have an
efficient algorithm that inverts F, okay?

56
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:22,963
So I'm proving the contra positive.
Suppose F is not one way. Then A is an

57
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:27,457
efficient algorithm than an inverse F. And
now I need to build an algorithm B that

58
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:32,301
breaks the pseudorandom generator. Ok, so I'm proving again by contra-positive. Okay so how do I break the

59
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:38,500
pseudo-random generator? Well, all we do
is the following. So algorithm B is given

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,406
some y in the set Y. And what it's gonna
do is the following, it's gonna try and

61
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:47,608
run algorithm a on the input y. And now,
well, if y is the output of the

62
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:52,109
pseudorandom generator, then algorithm A
will output the seed, and namely

63
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:56,861
[inaudible] an element in X with, you
know, non-negligible probability. So what

64
00:04:56,861 --> 00:05:02,112
we'll do is we'll apply the pseudorandom
generator again to the output of algorithm

65
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:06,989
A. As I said, if y was the output of a
generator, then [A of A ???] will have output

66
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:12,240
the seed cuz it inverted the pseudorandom
generator. So if we apply the pseudorandom

67
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,429
generator again to the output of A, what
we should get back is basically the y that

68
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:23,012
we started with. Okay, so if this
condition holds we're gonna say we're

69
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:28,090
gonna output zero. And if this condition
doesn't hold, we're gonna output one

70
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,955
otherwise. That's it, that's our
distinguisher against a pseudo-random

71
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:37,383
generator. So if our distinguisher is
given a y that is the output of the pseudo

72
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:41,755
random generator, then with non-negligible
probability, our distinguisher B will

73
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:46,238
output zero. However, if our distinguisher
B is given a truly random string. Well, a

74
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:50,832
truly random string doesn't have any seed
that causes the generator to output that

75
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:56,410
string. And therefore our distinguishable
output one with again, with also very high

76
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,291
probability. And again I hope that's
clear. Basically, if we look at the set of

77
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:06,129
all possible outputs, namely the set Y,
very few of those outputs happened to

78
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:10,370
be the output of the pseudorandom
generator. So if we are just given an

79
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,088
output y over hearsay, that's not the
output of the pseudorandom generator, then

80
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:19,687
we rerun algorithm A on it. It can't
possibly produce a seed that will output

81
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:24,227
this point starr because there is no
such seed. And as a result, since most

82
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:28,945
points actually are not in the image of
the pseudorandom generator, most points

83
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:33,462
will not have a seed that, maps the
generator to them and there's also where

84
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:38,130
we were given a random point in Y, a truly
uniform point in Y, our distinguishable B

85
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,011
will output 1 with very high
probability. However, if we are given a

86
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:46,679
pseudo random output of a generator, then
algorithm A will output the corresponding

87
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:51,235
seed. When we apply the generator to that
seed, we'll get the initial output y and

88
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:55,356
therefore we'll output zero with
non-negligible probability. Okay, so if A

89
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:59,546
was able to invert F, then B is able to
break the generator. And since the

90
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:04,024
generator is secure, algorithm A can't
invert F. And in particular, no efficient

91
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:08,559
algorithm can invert F. And therefore, F
is a one-way function. Excellent, so this

92
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:12,788
is a long discussion of kind of a minor
point. But all I wanted to show you is

93
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:16,562
that in fact, a pseudo-random generator
directly gives us a one-way function.

94
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:20,633
Unfortunately, this one-way function has
no special properties. And what that means

95
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:24,754
is it's actually difficult to use it for
key exchange or for public key encryption.

96
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:28,578
In some sense, the best key exchange we
can do with this, as far as we know, is

97
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:32,868
Merkle puzzles. So now let's look at
our second example. The second example is

98
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:37,200
what I'm gonna call the discrete log one
way function. So let's fix a group, a

99
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,971
cyclic group of order N the group G and
let g be some generator of the group

100
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:46,987
capital G so again I remind you that all
that means is, if I look at all powers of

101
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:51,335
g, then I basically span the entire group
capital G. And now let's define the

102
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:56,068
following function. The function goes from
ZN to G and it's defined basically as the

103
00:07:56,068 --> 00:08:00,802
exponentiation to the power of X. Okay, so
this maps any element between zero and n-1

104
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:04,915
to an element of the group capital G
simply by raising g, little g to the

105
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:09,197
appropriate power. And it's kind of
obvious that if the discrete log problem

106
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:13,310
in the group capital G is hard, then in
fact f is one way. In fact, the one

107
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,134
wayness of f is the discrete log
assumption. So if the discrete log is

108
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:21,324
hard, f is one way. Now the interesting
thing about this one-way functions is it's

109
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:25,800
got some interesting properties. In
particular, if I give you f(x) and f(y)

110
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,119
I claim that it's very easy to compute
f(x + y). Even though we have no idea

111
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:36,118
what x or y are. All we're given is just f(x) and f(y), nevertheless, we can

112
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:41,763
compute f(x + y). Let me ask you, how
would you do that? Well, just by rules of

113
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:46,732
exponentiation, basically, f(x + y)
is simply f(x) times f(y). And again,

114
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:51,826
this is all done inside the group G. If
you're not convinced, simply recall that f(x + y)

115
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:57,046
is g to the (x + y). Which is
simply g to the x times g to the y, which

116
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:02,161
is exactly what we have here. And this
simple property, this simple fact that the

117
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:06,936
function has this additive property, if
you think about it, is exactly what

118
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:11,722
enables key exchange and public key
encryption. So, this additional property

119
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:16,602
of the one-way function is what enabled
all of public key cryptography. So let's

120
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:21,723
look at our next example the RSA one way
function so here we're going to choose two

121
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:27,093
primes p and q we're going to set N to be p
times q then were going to choose e that's

122
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:31,612
relatively prime to phi(N). And then, we
define the functions, and simply as a

123
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:36,156
function from ZN star to ZN star,
simply as f(x) equals x to the e. Okay,

124
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:40,312
so raising x to the power of e. And again
we say that this function is one way,

125
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:44,575
simply under the RSA assumption. Again,
the RSA assumption is the assumption that

126
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:48,519
this function is one way. And the
interesting thing about this function is

127
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,941
that it has properties similar to the one
that we saw on the previous slide, namely

128
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:57,258
the given f(x) and f(y), now we can
compute f(x  y) as opposed to f(x + y)

129
00:09:57,258 --> 00:10:01,627
So we say that this function has
a multiplicative property as opposed to

130
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:05,438
the additive property on the previous
slide. But more importantly this is kind of

131
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,213
not the most interesting thing about this
function. The really exciting thing about

132
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:12,708
this function is it in fact has a
trapdoor. In other words there's a secret

133
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,505
key that all of a sudden allows us to
invert this function. Even though without

134
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:20,679
the secret key the function is one way. As
far as we know. And this property, I'll

135
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:24,337
say, the fact that it has a trap door,
again, enabled all of public key

136
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:28,632
cryptography. I'll say that this trap door
also makes the RSA function especially

137
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:32,820
well suited for digital signatures. In
week seven, we're gonna see that both the

138
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,478
RSA function and the discrete log
functions let us construct digital

139
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:40,614
signatures. But the RSA function, because
it has a trap door, makes it very, very

140
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:44,484
easy to construct digital signatures from
it. And so, in fact, most digital

141
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:48,301
signatures out there in the world, in
fact, rely on the RSA function just

142
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:52,459
because it's so simple to build digital
signatures from it. So again, we see that

143
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:56,085
this one-way function with the special
properties. It has a multiplicative

144
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:59,859
property and a trap door. Essentially
again, enables all of public key crypto. So

145
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,682
to summarize, the reason we are able to
build public key cryptography namely, the

146
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:07,416
reason we're able to do key exchange and
public key encryption and so on, is

147
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,485
because we're able to construct one-way
functions that have very, very special

148
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:15,555
properties. In particular, they have these
properties that are sometimes called

149
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:20,476
homomorphic properties, namely they're
given f(x) and f(y). We can construct

150
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:26,759
a f(x + y) or, f(x  y), and
some functions, like RSA, even have trap

151
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,059
doors, which let us build digital
signatures very, very easily. But the main

152
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:36,283
thing I wanted to show you is that the
magic of public key crypto is basically made

153
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:40,250
possible because of these one-way
functions with their special properties. So

154
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,268
that's the end of this module and then
in week seven, we'll start with digital signatures.
