1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,722
In the last segment, we looked at a
padding Oracle attack that completely

2
00:00:03,722 --> 00:00:08,005
breaks an authenticated encryption system.
I hope this attack convinces you that you

3
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:10,979
shouldn't implement authenticated
encryption on your own cause you might end

4
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:15,950
up exposing yourself to a padding oracle
attack or a timing attack or any other

5
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,936
such attack. Instead you should be using
standards like GCM or any other of the

6
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:23,710
standardized authenticated encryption
modes as implemented in many crypto

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,712
libraries. In this segment, I'm gonna show
you another very clever attack on an

8
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:31,770
authenticated encryption system. And I
hope after you see this attack, you'll be

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,468
completely convinced not to invent and
implement your own authenticated

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,526
encryption systems. But instead, always
use one of the standard schemes, like GCM

11
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:44,380
or others. So this particular attack that
I want to show you is an attack on the SSH

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,996
binary packet protocol. So SSH is a
standard secure remote shell application

13
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:53,679
that uses a protocol between a client
and the sever. It has a key exchange

14
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,794
mechanism and once two sides exchange keys,
SSH uses what's called the binary packet

15
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:03,662
protocol to send messages back and forth
between the client and the server. Now

16
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:09,731
here is how SSH works, so recall that SSH
uses what we called encrypt-and-MAC. Okay

17
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:13,707
so technically what happens is every SSH
packet begins with a sequence number, and

18
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:18,245
then the packet contains the packet
length, the length of the CBC pad, the

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:24,020
actual payload follows, then the CBC pad
follows. Now this whole red block here is

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,867
CBC encrypted also with a chained IV, so
this is also vulnerable to the CPA attacks

21
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:34,191
that we discussed before. But
nevertheless, this whole red packet is

22
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:39,033
encrypted using CBC encryption. And then
the entire clear text packet is MAC-ed.

23
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:43,169
And the MAC is sent in the clear, along
with the packet. So I want you to remember

24
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:48,837
that the MAC is computed over plain text
packets, and then the MAC is sent in the

25
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:53,597
clear. This is what we call encrypt-and-MAC. 
And we said that this is not a good

26
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:58,330
way to do things, because MACs have no
confidentiality requirements. And by sending

27
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:03,064
the MAC of the clear text in the clear,
you might be exposing information about

28
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:06,347
the clear text. But this is not the
mistake that I want to show you here. I

29
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:09,702
want to show you a much more clever attack.
So first, let's look at how decryption

30
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:16,068
works in SSH. So what happens is, first of
all, the server decrypts the encrypted

31
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:21,520
packet length field only. So it only
decrypts these particular first few bytes.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,440
Then it will go ahead and read from the
network, as many bytes as specified in the

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,000
packet length field. It's gonna decrypt the
remaining cipher text blocks using CBC

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,740
decryption. Then, once it's recovered the
entire SSH packet, it will go ahead and

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,540
check the MAC of the plain text, and
report an error if the MAC happens to be

36
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,645
invalid. Now the problem here is that the
packet length field is decrypted and then

37
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:50,107
used directly to determine the length of
the packet before any authentication has

38
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:54,780
taken place. In fact, it's not possible to
verify the MAC of the packet length field

39
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,647
because we haven't recovered the entire
packet yet and as a result we cannot check

40
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:04,074
the MAC. But nevertheless the protocol uses
the packet length before verifying that the MAC

41
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:09,501
is valid. So it turns out this introduces a
very, very cute attack. And I'm only

42
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:12,943
gonna describe a very simplified version
of this attack, just to get the idea

43
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:17,244
across. So here's the idea. Suppose the
attacker intercepted a particular cipher

44
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:23,037
text block, namely the direct AES
encryption of the message block M. And now

45
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:27,092
he wants to recover this M. And I
emphasize that this intercepted

46
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:31,418
cipher text is only one block length.
It's one AES block. So here's what the

47
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:37,073
attacker is gonna do. Well, he's gonna
send a packet to the server that starts

48
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:41,062
off as normal. It's basically, starts off
with a sequence number and then he's going

49
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:46,304
to inject his captured cipher text as the
first cipher text block that's sent to the

50
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,237
server. Now, what is the server going to
do? The server is gonna decrypt the first

51
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:57,270
few bytes of this first AES block and he's
going to interpret the first few bytes as

52
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,973
the length fields of the packet. The next
thing that's gonna happen is, the server

53
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:06,842
is gonna expect this many bytes, before it
checks that the MAC is valid. And so what

54
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:12,089
the attacker is gonna do, is, he's gonna
feed the server one byte at a time. So the

55
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:15,390
server will read one byte, and then
another byte, and then another byte.

56
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,007
Eventually, the server will read as many
bytes as the length field specifies, at

57
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:24,625
which point, it will check that the MAC is
valid. And of course, the attacker was

58
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:29,477
just feeding the server junk bytes. And as
a result, the MAC is not gonna verify, and

59
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,978
the server will send a MAC error. But you
realize that what happened here, the

60
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:38,362
attacker was counting how many bytes it
sent to the server. And so it knows

61
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:43,097
exactly how many bytes were sent at the
time that it receives the MAC error from

62
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:48,288
the server. So that tells it that the
decryption of the first 32 bits of its

63
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:54,177
cypher text C are exactly equal to the
number of bytes that were sent before it

64
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:57,374
saw the MAC error. So this is a very
clever attack. So let me say it one more

65
00:04:57,374 --> 00:05:02,556
time to make sure this is clear. So again,
the attacker has a one block cipher text C

66
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:07,407
that it wants to decrypt and let's pretend
that when C is decrypted the 32 most

67
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:12,309
significant bits of the plain text happen
to be the number five. In this case, what

68
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:17,092
the attacker will see, is the following
behavior. The server is gonna decrypt the

69
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:21,815
challenge block c and he's gonna obtain
the number five as the length field. So,

70
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:26,777
now, the attacker is gonna feed the server
one byte at a time and after the attacker

71
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:31,500
feeds the server five bytes the server
says, hey, I've just recovered the entire

72
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,984
packet, let me check the MAC. The MAC is
likely to be false and, then, it will

73
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:41,156
send, bad MAC error. So after five bytes
are read off the network the attacker is

74
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:45,447
gonna see a bad MAC error and then the
attacker learns that the most significant

75
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:51,689
32 bits of the decrypted block is equal to
the number five. So there. So, you just

76
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:56,705
learned the 32 most significant bits of
C. So this is a very significant attack,

77
00:05:56,705 --> 00:06:01,731
because the attacker just learned 32 bits
of the decrypted cipher text block. And

78
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:05,767
since he can apply this attack to any
cipher text block he wants, he can

79
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:11,410
basically learn the first 32 bits of every
cipher text block in a very long message.

80
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,542
So what just happened here? Well, there
are actually two things that were wrong in

81
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,340
this design. The first one is the
decryption operation is non-atomic. In

82
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,206
other words, the decryption algorithm
doesn't take a whole packet as input, and

83
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:29,903
respond with a whole plain text as output,
or with the word reject. Instead, the

84
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:34,362
decryption algorithm partially decrypts
the cipher text, namely to obtain the

85
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:39,476
length field, and then it waits to recover
as many bytes as needed and then it

86
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:43,924
completes the decryption process. So these
nonatomic decryption operations are fairly

87
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:48,500
dangerous, and generally, they should be
avoided. In this example, this nonatomic

88
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,791
decryption happens to break authenticated
encryption. The other problem that

89
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:57,105
happened is that the length field was used
before it was properly authenticated. And

90
00:06:57,105 --> 00:07:01,470
this is another issue that should never be
done. So the encryption field should never

91
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,388
be used before the field is actually
authenticated. So let me ask you, if you

92
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:09,449
had the option of redesigning SSH what is
the minimum change that you would do to

93
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,754
make SSH resist this attack? And let me
tell you that multiple answers might be

94
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:18,259
correct. One option is to send a length
field in the clear, just as in the case of

95
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,741
TLS. In this case, there's no opportunity
for an attacker to submit chosen cipher

96
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:26,998
text attack, because, well, the length
field is never decrypted. And so there's

97
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:31,603
no decryption taking place that the attacker 
can abuse. Replacing encrypt-and-MAC

98
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:36,211
by encrypt-then-MAC doesn't have any
impact because this attack would apply

99
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:39,935
either way. The problem is that the length
field is used before it's authenticated

100
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:44,243
and that would have to happen either way.
So a better mode of encryption doesn't

101
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:48,498
actually help. Another option is to MAC
the length field separately so that now

102
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:52,591
the server can read the length field,
check that the MAC for just the length

103
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:56,845
field is valid, and then it would know how
many subsequent bytes to read before

104
00:07:56,845 --> 00:08:00,916
checking MAC field on the entire packet.
The last option is actually one that

105
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,906
works, but is terribly inefficient, and it
would expose the server to a denial of

106
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:09,322
service attack, so I'm not going to mark
it as a valid answer. So the main lesson

107
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:14,295
to remember is, don't implement or design
your own authenticated encryption system.

108
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:18,723
Just use the standards like GCM. But if
for some reason, you can't use the

109
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:22,572
standards, and you have to implement your
own authenticated encryption system, then

110
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:28,356
use encrypt-then-MAC. And make sure not
to repeat the mistakes of the last two

111
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:33,228
segments, namely don't use a length field
before the length field is authenticated.

112
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:37,388
And more generally, don't use any
decrypted field before that field is

113
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:40,991
authenticated. Okay so this is the end of
our discussion of authenticated

114
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:44,985
encryption. I wanted to point out a couple
of papers on authenticated encryption that

115
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:49,588
you could use as further reading. The
first one is a very cute one on the order

116
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:53,918
of encryption and authentication that talks
about whether one should do encrypt-then-MAC

117
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:56,796
or MAC-then-encrypt and it
shows that one is correct and one is

118
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:59,912
incorrect. It's a good read and there's a
lot of information in that paper. The

119
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:04,476
second discusses OCB mode, which is a very
efficient way of building authenticated

120
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:08,984
encryption. In particular, it looks at a
variant of OCB with associated data as we

121
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:13,548
discussed when we described OCB. The last
three papers are attack papers. The first

122
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:17,890
one describes the padding oracle attack
that we discussed in the last segment.

123
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,398
This one here describes the length attack
that we just described in this segment.

124
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:28,838
And the last one describes a number of
attacks on encryptions that just use CPA

125
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:34,038
security without adding integrity. So this
last paper actually provides a number of

126
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:38,518
good examples for why CPA security by
itself should never, ever, ever be used

127
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:43,116
for encryption. Remember the only thing
you're allowed to use is authenticated

128
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:47,302
encryption for confidentiality. Or if all
you need is integrity with no

129
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:49,660
confidentiality then you just use a MAC.
