1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
In the last segment we defined
authenticated encryption, but I didn't

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,517
really show you why authenticated
encryption is the right notion of

3
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:09,818
security. In this segment I want to show
you that authenticated encryption in fact

4
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:14,431
is a very natural notion of security and
I'll do it by showing you that it defends

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,358
against a very powerful attack called a
chosen cipher text attack. So in fact we

6
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:23,320
already saw a number of examples of a
chosen cipher text attack so imagine the

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,552
adversary has some cipher text C that
it wants to decrypt. And what it can do

8
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:31,921
is, for example, fool the decryption
server into decrypting some cipher text

9
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:36,707
but not actually the cipher text c. So we
already saw some examples of that. If you

10
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:41,551
remember in the first segment, we looked
at an adversary that can submit arbitrary

11
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:46,394
cipher text, and if the plaintext happened
to start with destination equals 25, then

12
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:50,664
the adversary is actually given the
plaintext in the clear. So that's an

13
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:55,672
example of an adversary that can obtain
the decryption of certain cipher texts but

14
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:59,966
not all cipher texts. Another example we
saw is an adversary that can learn

15
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:04,058
something about the plaintext by
submitting cipher texts to the decrypter.

16
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:08,374
So we have this example where the
adversary submits encrypted TCP/IP packets

17
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:12,623
to the decryption server, and if the
decryption server sends back an ACK, the

18
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:17,053
adversary learns that the decrypted plain
text had a valid check sum. And otherwise,

19
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:21,057
the decrypted plain text didn't have a
valid check sum. So this is, again, an

20
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:25,220
example of a chosen cipher text attack,
where the attacker submits cipher text,

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,680
and learns something about the decryption
of that cipher text. So to address this

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,457
type of threats, we're gonna define a very
general notion of security, called chosen

23
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:39,060
cipher text security. So here, we're gonna
give the adversary a lot of power, okay?

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,376
So he can do both chosen plain text
attack, and a chosen cipher text attack.

25
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:47,577
In other words, he can obtain the
encryption of arbitrary messages of his

26
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:52,648
choice. And he can decrypt any cipher text
of his choice, other than some challenge

27
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:57,501
cipher texts. And as I showed you before,
this is actually a fairly conservative

28
00:01:57,501 --> 00:02:01,862
modeling of real life. In real life,
often, the attacker can fool the, the

29
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:06,961
decrypter, into decrypting certain cipher
texts for the attacker, but not all cipher

30
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,986
texts. So the model here is that the
attacker has a certain cipher text that it

31
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:14,992
wants to decrypt. It can interact with
the decrypter by issuing these chosen

32
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:18,749
cipher text queries to the decrypter.
Namely, to decrypt various cipher text

33
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:22,706
other than the challenge cipher text. And
then the adversary's goal is to break

34
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:27,149
semantic security of the challenge cipher
text. So you notice that we're giving the

35
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:31,164
adversary a lot of power. And all we're
asking you to do is break semantic

36
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:35,036
security. So it's going to be fairly
difficult to design systems that are

37
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:38,663
secure against such adversaries.
Nevertheless, we're going to do it. So

38
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:42,828
let's define the chosen cipher text
security model more precisely. So, as

39
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:47,224
usual, we have a cipher (E, D). And we're
gonna define two experiments, experiment

40
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:51,447
zero and experiment one. So this should
look somewhat familiar by now. The

41
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:56,017
challenger is gonna start off by choosing
a random key. And now the adversary is

42
00:02:56,017 --> 00:03:00,587
gonna submit queries to this challenger.
Every query can be one of two types. It

43
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:05,123
can be a chosen plain text query, or it
can be a chosen cipher text query. So a

44
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:09,851
chosen plain text query, as we already
know. Basically, the adversary submits two

45
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:14,724
messages, M zero and M1. They have to be
the same length. And the adversary

46
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:19,870
receives the encryption of either M zero
if we're in experiment zero, or M1, if we're

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,991
in experiment one. So he receives the
encryption of the left or the right

48
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:27,845
depending on whether we were in experiment
zero or in experiment one. The second type

49
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:32,323
of query is the more interesting one. This
is where the adversary submits an arbitrary

50
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:37,026
cipher text of his choice and what he gets
back is the decryption of that cipher

51
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:41,994
text. So you notice the adverary's allowed
to decrypt arbitrary cipher texts of his

52
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:47,237
choice. The only restriction is that the
cipher text is not one of the cipher texts

53
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:52,318
that were obtained as a result of a CPA
query. And of course this wouldn't be fair

54
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,338
otherwise, because the attacker can simply
take one cipher text that was obtained

55
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:01,538
from a CPA query. That's gonna to be
either the encryption of M0 or the

56
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:06,604
encryption of M1. If he could submit a CCA
query for that particular cipher text, he

57
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:12,024
will in response either obtain M0 or M1,
and then he'll know whether he is in experiment

58
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:17,003
zero or experiment one. So this wouldn't
be fair. So we say that the CPA cipher

59
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:21,656
texts that he received are the challenge
cipher texts. And he's allowed to decrypt

60
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:26,460
any cipher texts of his choice, other than
these challenge cipher texts. And as

61
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,815
usual, his goal is to determine whether
he's in experiment zero, or in experiment

62
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:35,376
one. So I'm gonna emphasize again, that
this is an extremely powerful adversary.

63
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:39,878
One that can decrypt any cipher text of
his choice, other than the challenge

64
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:44,029
cipher text. And still, he can't
distinguish whether he is in experiment

65
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:48,806
zero, or in experiment one. So, as usual,
we say that the cipher is CCA secure,

66
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:52,757
chosen cipher text secure, if the
adversary behaves the same in experiment

67
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:57,621
zero as it does in experiment one. Namely, it
cannot distinguish the two experiments. So

68
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:02,075
let's start with a simple example, and
show that, in fact, CBC with a random IV,

69
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:06,763
is not CCA secure, is not secure against
chosen cipher text attacks. So let's see

70
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:10,173
why that's the case. So what the
adversary's gonna start by doing, he's

71
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:15,553
gonna simply submit two distinct messages,
M0 and M1. And let's just pretend that

72
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:20,055
these messages are one block messages. And
what he's gonna get back is the CBC

73
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:24,846
encryption of either M0 or
M1. You notice the cipher text only has

74
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:29,348
one block, because the plain texts were
only one block long. Now what is the

75
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:34,685
attacker gonna do? Well, he's gonna modify
this cipher text C that he was given into

76
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:39,958
C prime simply by changing the IV. Okay?
So he just takes the IV and XORs it with

77
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:44,910
one. That's it. This gives a new cipher
text, C prime, which is different from C

78
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,989
and as a result it's perfectly valid for
the adversary to submit C prime as its

79
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:55,134
chosen cipher text query. So he
asks the challenger please decrypt this C

80
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:59,727
prime for me. The challenger, because c
prime is not equal to c, must decrypt c

81
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:04,307
prime. And now let's see, what happens
when he decrypts c prime? Well, what's the

82
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:09,497
decryption of c prime, let me ask you. So
you probably remember from the first

83
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:14,657
segment that if we xor the IV by one, that
simply xors the plaintext by one. So now

84
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:20,997
that adversary received M0 xor one, or M1
xor one, and now he can perfectly tell

85
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:25,435
whether he's in experiment zero and, or in
experiment one. So the advantage of this

86
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:30,075
adversary is basically one, because he can
very easily tell which experiment he's in.

87
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:34,922
And as a result he can win the chosen
cipher text security game. So if you think

88
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:39,337
about it for a second, you'll see that
this attack game exactly captured the first

89
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:43,696
active attack that we saw, where the
adversary slightly changed the cipher text

90
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:47,614
that he was given. And then he got the
decrypter to decrypt it for him. And

91
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:51,918
therefore, he was able to eavesdrop on
messages that were not intended for the

92
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,479
adversary. So I wanna emphasize again that
this chosen cipher text game really does

93
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,863
come up in real life, where the adversary
can submit cipher texts to the decrypter

94
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,193
and the decrypter can reveal information
about the plain text, or it can give the

95
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:09,465
plain text outright to the adversary for
certain cipher texts but not others. So

96
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:13,571
this is a very natural notion of security,
and the question is, how do we design

97
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:17,795
crypto-systems that are CCA secure? So I
claim that this authenticated encryption

98
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:21,875
notion that we defined before actually
implies chosen cipher text security, and

99
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,887
this is why authenticated encryption is
such a natural concept. Okay? So the

100
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:30,733
theorem basically says, well, if you give
me a cipher that provides authenticated

101
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:35,041
encryption, the cipher can withstand
chosen cipher text attacks. And more

102
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:39,767
precisely, the theorem says the following.
If we have an adversary that issues Q

103
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:44,374
queries, in other words, at most, q CPA
queries and q chosen cipher text queries,

104
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:49,160
then there are two efficient adversaries,
B1 and B2, that satisfy this inequality

105
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,328
here. So since the scheme has
authenticated encryption, we know that

106
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:58,052
this quantity is negligible because it's
CPA secure. And we know that this

107
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:02,072
quantity is negligible because the
encryption scheme has cipher text

108
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:06,210
integrity. And as a result, since both
terms are negligible we know that

109
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,857
adversary's advantage in winning the CCA
game is also negligible. So let's prove

110
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:14,947
this theorem. It's actually a very simple
theorem to prove. And so let's just do it

111
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:20,581
as proof by pictures. Okay, so here we
have two copies of the CCA game, so this

112
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:25,190
would be experiment zero. And the bottom
one is experiment one. You can see the

113
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,783
adversary's issuing CPA queries, and he's
issuing CCA queries, and at the end he

114
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:34,954
outputs, you know, a certain guess b,
let's call it b prime, and our goal is to

115
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:38,926
show that this b prime is
indistinguishable in both cases. In other

116
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:43,247
words, probability that b prime is equal
to one in the top game is the same as the

117
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:47,586
probability that b prime is equal to one
in the bottom game. Okay, so the way we're

118
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:50,903
gonna do it is the following. Well, first
of all, we're gonna change the challenger

119
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:55,761
a little bit, so that instead of actually
outputting the decryption of CCA queries,

120
00:08:55,761 --> 00:09:01,128
the challenger is just gonna always output
bottom. So every time the adversary

121
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:05,652
submits a CCA query, the challenger says
bottom. And I claim that these two

122
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:08,773
games are, in fact, indistinguishable. In
other words, the adversary can't

123
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:13,650
distinguish these two games, for the
simple reason that, because the scheme has

124
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,722
cipher text integrity, the adversary
simply cannot create a cipher text that's

125
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:24,197
not in C1 to CI-1 that decrypts to
anything other than bottom. That is the

126
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:28,777
definition of cipher text integrity. And
as a result, again, because of cipher text

127
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:33,019
integrity, it must be the case that every
chosen cipher text query that the

128
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:37,430
adversary issues results in bottom. If the
adversary, in fact, could distinguish

129
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,898
between the left game and the right game,
that would mean that at some point he

130
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:46,592
issued a query that decrypted to something
other than bottom. And that we could use

131
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:50,795
to then break cipher text integrity of the
scheme. And since the scheme has

132
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:54,977
cipher-text integrity, these left and
right games are indistinguishable. Okay,

133
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:59,324
so that's kind of a cute argument that
shows that it's very easy to respond to

134
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:03,836
chosen cipher-text queries when you have
cipher-text integrity. And the same thing

135
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,673
exactly applies on the bottom, where we
can simply replace the chosen cipher-text

136
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:12,623
responses by just always saying bottom.
Okay, very good. But now, since the chosen

137
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:17,208
cipher text queries always respond in the
same way, they're not giving the adversary

138
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:21,574
any information. The adversary always
knows that we're always gonna just respond

139
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:25,668
with bottom. So we might as well just
remove these queries, 'cause they don't

140
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:29,769
contribute any information to the
adversary. But now, once we remove these

141
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,339
queries, the resulting game should look
fairly familiar. The top right game, and

142
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:39,144
the [bottom right] game are basically the two
games that come up in the definition of

143
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:43,773
CPA security. And as a result, because the
scheme is CPA secure, we know that the

144
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:48,508
adversary can't distinguish the top from
the bottom. And so now, by this change of

145
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:53,165
reasoning, we've proven that all of these
games are equivalent. And in particular,

146
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:57,022
the original two games that we started
with are also equivalent, and therefore,

147
00:10:57,022 --> 00:11:02,364
the adversary can't distinguish the top
left from the bottom left. And therefore,

148
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:06,896
the scheme is CCA secure. So this gives
you the intuition as to why authenticated

149
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:11,236
encryption is such a cool concept. Because
primarily it implies security against

150
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:15,199
chosen cipher test attacks. Okay, so as we
said authenticated encryption

151
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:19,094
ensures confidentiality. Even if the
adversary can decrypt a subset of the

152
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:23,476
cipher text, and more generally, even if
he can mount a general chosen cipher text attack,

153
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:27,965
he still is not going to be able to break
semantic security of the system. However,

154
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:31,914
it is important to remember the two
limitations. First of all, it does not

155
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:36,350
prevent replay attacks on its own. We're
going to have to do something in addition

156
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,785
to defend against replay attacks. We're
going to see several examples where if the

157
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:45,221
decryption engine reveals more information
about why a cipher text is rejected, it

158
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:49,278
doesn't just output bottom, but it
actually outputs more information, say, by

159
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,744
timing attacks. And that explains why the
cipher text is rejected. Then in fact that

160
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:58,120
can completely destroy security of the
authenticated encryption system. So we'll

161
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,245
see some cute attacks like this in a later
segment. Okay. So, in the next segment

162
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:05,394
we're gonna turn to constructing
authenticated encryption systems.
