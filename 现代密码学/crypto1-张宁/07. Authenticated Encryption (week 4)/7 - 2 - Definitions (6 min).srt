1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:03,017
In the last segment, we saw two active
attacks that can completely destroy the

2
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:08,354
security of CPA secure encryption. In this
segment, we're gonna define a new concept,

3
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:12,183
called authenticated encryption, that
remains secure in the presence of an

4
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:16,978
active adversary. In later segments, we'll
construct encryption schemes that satisfy

5
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:21,007
this new authenticated encryption concept.
So what is authenticated encryption?

6
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:25,866
Authenticated encryption is a cipher where
as usual the encryption algorithm takes a

7
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:31,234
key, a message and optionally a nonce and outputs
a cipher text. The decryption algorithm as

8
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:35,795
usual outputs a message. However, here the
decryption algorithm is allowed to output

9
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:40,594
a special symbol called bottom. When the
decryption algorithm outputs the symbol

10
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,887
bottom, basically it says that the cipher
text is invalid and should be ignored. The

11
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:49,198
only requirement is that this bottom is
not in the message space so that in fact

12
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:53,655
it is a unique symbol that indicates that
the cipher text should be rejected. Now

13
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:57,175
what does it mean for an authenticated
encryption system to be secure? Well the

14
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:00,774
system has to satisfy two properties. The
first property is that it has to be

15
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:05,035
semantically secure under a chosen
plaintext attack just as before. But now

16
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:08,881
there's a second property which says that
the system also has to satisfy what's

17
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:13,063
called cipher text integrity. What that
means is that even though the attacker

18
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:17,145
gets to see a number of cipher texts, it
should not be able to produce another

19
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:21,360
cipher text that decrypts properly. In
other words, that decrypts to something

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,813
other than bottom. More precisely,
let's look at the ciphertext integrity game.

21
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:30,923
So here, (E,D) is a cipher with message
space M. As usual, the challenger begins

22
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:35,635
by choosing a random key K. And
the adversary can submit messages of his

23
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:40,229
choice, and receive the encryptions of
those messages. So here, C1 is the

24
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,617
encryption of M1, where M1 was chosen by
the adversary. And the adversary can do

25
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:47,677
this repeatedly. In other words, he
submits M2 and obtains the encryption of

26
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:52,867
M2, and so on and so forth. He submits
many more messages up until Mq and obtains

27
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:58,499
the encryption of all those messages. So
here the adversary obtained Q cipher texts

28
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:03,851
for messages of his choice. Then his goal
is to produce some new cipher text that's

29
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:08,883
valid. So we'll say that the adversary
wins the game if basically this new cipher

30
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:12,820
text that the adversary created decrypts
correctly, in other words decrypts to

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,507
something other than bottom. And it's a
new cipher text. In other words, it's not

32
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:20,722
one of the cipher texts that was given to
the adversary as part of this chosen

33
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:24,499
plaintext attack. And then as usual we
defined the adversary's advantage in the

34
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:28,963
cipher text integrity game as the
probability that the challenger outputs

35
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:32,787
one at the end of the game and we'll say
that the cipher has cipher text integrity

36
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:37,754
if in fact for all efficient adversaries
the advantage in winning this game is

37
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:41,615
negligible. So now that we understand
what cipher text integrity is we can

38
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:45,090
define authenticated encryption and
basically we say that the cipher has

39
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,787
authenticated encryption if as we said
it's semantically secure under a chosen

40
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:54,304
plaintext attack and it also has cipher
text integrity. So just as a bad example,

41
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:59,456
let me mention that CBC with a random IV
does not provide authenticated encryption

42
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,812
because it's very easy for the adversary
to win the cipher text integrity game.

43
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:07,080
The adversary simply submits a random cipher text

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,375
and since the decryption algorithm for 
CBC encryption never outputs bottom,

45
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,941
it always outputs some message, 
the adversary just easily wins the game.

46
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:18,883
Any old random cipher text will decrypt 
to something other than bottom

47
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:23,110
and therefore the adversary directly wins 
the cipher-text integrity game. So this is just

48
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,686
a trivial example of a CPA secure cipher that 
does not provide authenticated encryption.

49
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:32,755
So I wanna mention two implications of
authenticated encryption. The first I'll

50
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:37,347
call authenticity, which means that,
basically, an attacker cannot fool the

51
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:42,026
recipient, Bob, into thinking that Alice
sent a certain message that she didn't

52
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:46,154
actually send. So let's see what I mean by
that. Well, here, the attacker basically

53
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:50,762
gets to interact with Alice, and get her
to encrypt arbitrary messages of his

54
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:56,516
choice. So this is a chosen plain text
attack. And then the attacker's goal is to

55
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:01,882
produce some cipher text that was not
actually created by Alice. And because the

56
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:06,213
attacker can't win the cipher text
integrity game, he can't do this. What

57
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,914
this means is, when Bob receives the
cipher text that decrypts correctly under

58
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:14,570
the decryption algorithm, he knows that
the message must have come from someone

59
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,317
who knows the secret key K. In particular,
if Alice is the only one who knows K, then

60
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:23,325
he knows the cipher text really did come
from Alice, and it's not some modification

61
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:28,307
that was sent by the attacker. Now the
only caveat to that is that authenticated

62
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:32,099
encryption doesn't defend against replay
attacks. In particular, the attacker

63
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:36,214
could've intercepted some cipher text from
Alice to Bob. And could have replayed it

64
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:40,762
and both cipher text would look valid to
Bob. So for example, Alice might send a

65
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:46,915
message to Bob saying transfer $100 to
Charlie. Then Charlie could replay that

66
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:51,498
cipher text and as a result, Bob would
transfer another $100 to Charlie. So in

67
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:55,419
fact, any encryption protocol has to
defend against replay attacks and this is

68
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,342
not something that's directly prevented by
authenticated encryption. And we'll come

69
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:02,930
back and talk about replay attacks in two
segments. The second implication of

70
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,987
authenticated encryption is that it
defends against a very powerful type of

71
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:11,480
adversary, namely an adversary that can
mount what's called a chosen cipher text

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,933
attack. We're going to talk about that
actually in the next segment.
