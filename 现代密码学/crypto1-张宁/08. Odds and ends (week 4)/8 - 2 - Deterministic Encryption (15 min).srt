1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,045
In this segment, we're gonna look at the
concept of deterministic encryption that

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:08,040
often comes up in practice. When I say
deterministic encryption system, I mean an

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,001
encryption system that will always map
given message to exactly the same cipher

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,981
text. So if we encrypt the same message
three times, every time we'll get exactly

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:19,885
the same cipher text. So there are no
nonces involved here. Literally this is

6
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:24,143
just a consistence encryption scheme that
will always output the same cipher text

7
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:28,100
given a particular message. So let's see
where this comes up in practice and in

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,158
particular, I want to show you the case of
look-ups into an encrypted database. So

9
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:36,416
the settings are imagine we have a server
here that is going to store information

10
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,524
inside of an encrypted database. So what
it will store is records, and every record

11
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:44,736
has an index and some data that's stored
inside of the record. Now, the first thing

12
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:48,886
the server's gonna do is, it's gonna
encrypt this record. So here's a record

13
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:53,479
became encrypted and you notice that the
index became encrypted with K1 and the

14
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,851
data is encrypted with K2 and then the
encrypted record is sent over to the

15
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:02,333
database. And the same thing happens to
many records so that the database overall

16
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:06,704
holds many, many encrypted records. Well,
again, you can imagine that the index is

17
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:11,131
encrypted using the key K1 and then the
data and the records is encrypted using

18
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:15,015
the key K2. Now, if encryption is
deterministic, the nice thing about that

19
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:19,096
is that, at a later time, when the server
wants to retrieve a record from the

20
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:23,338
database, all he needs to do is send to
the database an encryption of the index

21
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:27,741
that the server is interested in. So here,
it would send an encryption of the index,

22
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:32,091
Alice. That again, becomes encrypted, and
the resulting cipher text is identical to

23
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:36,172
the cipher text that was generated when
the record was first written to the

24
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:40,145
database. And the database can then, you
know, find the record that has this

25
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:44,462
encrypted index in it, and then send the
result back to the server. The nice thing

26
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:48,633
about this is that now the database is
completely in the dark as to what data is

27
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:52,959
stored in the database and it doesn't even
know what records are being retrieved by

28
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,128
the server since all it sees are basically
requests for encrypted entices. And so

29
00:01:57,128 --> 00:02:01,018
this deterministic encryption mechanism.
Let's just do a quick look up in the

30
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:04,858
database given an encrypted index and
we're guaranteed that because of the

31
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:09,209
deterministic encryption property that the
index is going to be encrypted in exactly

32
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,622
the same way as if was when the record was
created. And so this should be disturbing

33
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:17,936
to many of you because we previously said
that deterministic encryption simply

34
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:22,250
cannot be chosen plain text secure. The
problem is that an attacker can look at

35
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,729
different cipher text and if he sees the
same cipher text twice he knows that the

36
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,316
underlying encrypted messages must also be
the same. So in other words, by looking at

37
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:35,904
cipher text, he can learn something about
the corresponding plain text because every

38
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,382
time he sees the same cipher text twice,
he knows that the underlying messages are

39
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:44,603
equal. In practice, this leads to
significant attacks, and particularly when

40
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:49,240
the message space is small. For example,
if we're transmitting single bytes across

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,107
the network, such as, keystrokes that are
being transmitted one keystroke at a time.

42
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:58,573
Then, in fact, an attacker can simply
build a dictionary of all possible cipher

43
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:02,924
texts. If it's only single bytes, then
there will only be 256 possible cipher

44
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:07,561
texts. And then, simply by learning what
the decryptions of those cipher texts are,

45
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:11,970
he can actually figure out all future
cipher texts, simply by looking them up,

46
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:16,811
in this dictionary. And so there are many
cases where the message being so small,

47
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:21,256
where this, deterministic encryption,
simply is insecure. Now concretely, in the

48
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:25,357
case of an encrypted database, what the
attacker would see is if there are two

49
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:29,510
records that happen to have the same
cipher text in the index position then now

50
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,821
he knows that those two records correspond
to the same index. So again, even though

51
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:37,921
he doesn't know what the index is, he
learns something about the corresponding

52
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:42,400
plain text. I wanted to briefly remind you
that, formally, we say that deterministic

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,459
encryption cannot be CPA secure by
describing an adversary that wins the CPA

54
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,570
game. The chosen plain text attack game,
and let me quickly remind you how that

55
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,682
works. The game starts by the adversary
sending two messages, M zero and M zero.

56
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:58,740
And remember that, in this game, the
adversary is always going to be given the

57
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,852
encryption of the left message or the
encryption of the right message. In this

58
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:06,963
case, since he used the same message in
both cases, both on the left and on the

59
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:10,763
right, he's simply gonna get the
encryption of the message M zero. In the

60
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:14,979
next step, he's gonna send the messages M
zero, M1. And now he's either gonna get

61
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,874
the encryption of M zero, or the
encryption of M1. And his goal is to tell

62
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:22,823
which one he got. But because the
encryption is deterministic, this is very

63
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:26,985
easy for him to do. All he has to do is
just test whether C is equal to C zero.

64
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:31,467
And if C is equal to C zero, then he knows
that he got the encryption of M zero. If C

65
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:35,843
is not equal to C zero, he knows that he
got the encryption of M1. So he can output

66
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:40,422
zero. If C is equal to C0 and output one,
if C is not equal to C0 and his advantage

67
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:45,127
in this in this particular game would be
one. So it, it would be a high, as high an

68
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:49,719
advantage as possible which means that he
attacker completely defeats chosen

69
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:54,306
plain text security. Okay so, this is just
a formal way of saying that the attacker

70
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:58,631
basically learns more information about
the plain text than he should. So, the

71
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:03,579
question is, what do we do? And it turns
out the solution is basically to restrict

72
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:08,803
the type of messages that can be encrypted
under a single key. And so, the idea is to

73
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:13,839
say that suppose the encryptor never ever,
ever encrypts the same message under a

74
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,814
single key. In other words the message key
pair is always different and never

75
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:23,415
repeats. So that for every single
encryption, either the message changes, or

76
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:28,328
the key changes, but, or both change. But
it can't be that we encrypt the same

77
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:33,001
message twice under the same key. So why
would this ever happen? Well it turns out

78
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:37,152
there are very natural cases where this
happens. For example, if the messages

79
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:41,194
happen to be random. Say you, the
encryptors encrypting keys and those keys,

80
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:45,509
you know, say are 128 the keys so,
they'll never actually with very high

81
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,933
probability, they'll never repeat. In this
case when we're encrypting keys, in fact,

82
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,358
is very likely that all the messages that
are encrypted under one master key are

83
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:58,617
always distinct because, again, these keys
are very unlikely to ever repeat. The

84
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:03,021
other reason why messages would never
repeat is simply because of some structure

85
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:07,371
in the message space. For example, if all
we're encrypting are unique user IDs. So

86
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:11,612
imagine, in the database example, the
index corresponds to a unique user ID. And

87
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:15,690
if there's exactly one record in the
database for each user, that says that

88
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,040
every encrypted record basically contains
an encrypted index, where the index is

89
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,666
distinct for all records in the database.
Okay so these are two reasons why messages

90
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:29,460
might never repeat. And this is a fairly
reasonable thing that actually does happen

91
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:33,919
quite often in practice. So now if the
messages never repeat, now maybe we can

92
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,897
actually define security and actually give
constructions to satisfy our definitions.

93
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:43,646
So this motivates the concept of deterministic chosen plain text attacks and

94
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:48,511
let me explain what they mean. So as usual
we have a cipher defined as an encryption

95
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:53,029
on a decryption algorithm. So we have a
key space, a message space and a cipher

96
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:57,662
text space and we're gonna define security
just as normal using two experiments.

97
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:02,098
Experiment zero and experiment one. And
the game actually looks very similar, it's

98
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:06,233
almost an identical game to the standard
chosen playing test attack game where

99
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:10,630
basically the attacker issues queries, so
you can see these queries consist of pairs

100
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,609
of messages, M0 and M1. They, as usual
they have to be the same length and for

101
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:18,849
each query the attacker either gets the
encryption of M0 or the encryption of M1

102
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:22,984
and the attacker can do this again and
again. He can do this Q times, and at the

103
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,172
end of the game he's supposed to say
whether he got the encryptions of the left

104
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:31,613
messages or the encryptions of the right
messages. So this is the standard chosen

105
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:36,318
plain text attack game, but now there's
one extra caveat. Which is to say that, if

106
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:41,141
the bit is equal to zero, if B is equal to
zero. In other words, the attacker always

107
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:46,022
sees the encryption of the left messages,
then it so happens that the left messages

108
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:50,669
must all be distinct. In other words, he
will never get to see the encryption of

109
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:55,433
the same message twice, because these left
messages are always distinct. So if the

110
00:07:55,433 --> 00:08:00,298
bit B is equal to zero, again, he'll never
see. The same message encrypted under the

111
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:04,496
same key. Because, again, these zero
messages, M1 zero to MQ zero, are all

112
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:09,353
distinct. Similarly, we require that all
the one messages are also distinct. And so

113
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:13,851
that, again, if B happens to be equal to
one, the attacker will never see two

114
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:18,586
messages encrypted under the same key.
Okay? So this requirement that the, all

115
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:22,854
these messages are distinct, and
similarly, all these Q messages are

116
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:28,285
distinct. Basically captures this use case
that the encryptor will never encrypt the

117
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:33,005
same message multiple times using one
particular key. And as a result, the

118
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:37,983
attacker simply can't ask for, the
encryption of the same message multiple

119
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:42,573
times using the same key. Now, I should
point out as you go back to our, to the

120
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:47,033
original attack, here. So, here we go back
to our CPA attack on deterministic

121
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:51,436
encryption, you notice that here, in fact,
this is not a deterministic CPA game,

122
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:56,011
because, here, the attacker did ask for
the same message m0 to be encrypted twice.

123
00:08:56,011 --> 00:09:00,471
So, in fact, this attack would be an
illegal attack under the deterministic CPA

124
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:05,160
game. And by ruling out this attack we
actually make it plausible that we might

125
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,682
be able to give constructions that are
deterministic CPA secure. And so as usual

126
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,939
we say if the adversary cannot distinguish
experiment zero, when he's given the

127
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:17,819
encryption of the left messages, from
experiment one, when he's given the

128
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:22,128
encryption of the right messages, then the
scheme is semantically secure. Under a

129
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:26,202
deterministic CPA attack. Okay. So as
usual, we ask for what's the probability

130
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:30,114
that the adversary outputs one in
experiment zero? What's the probability

131
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:34,241
that the outputs one in experiment one?
Then if these probabilities are close then

132
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,475
his advantage in attacking the scheme is
negligible. And if that's true for all

133
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:42,710
efficient adversaries then we say that the
scheme is semantically secure under

134
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,199
deterministic CPA attack. So the first
thing I want to do is show you the cipher

135
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:51,722
block training with a fixed IV, in fact,
not deterministic CPA secure. And this a

136
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:56,188
common mistake that's used in practice.
There are many products that should be

137
00:09:56,188 --> 00:10:00,597
using a cipher that's deterministic CPA
secure, but instead, they just use CBC

138
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:05,177
with a fixed IV and assume that's a secure
mechanism. And in fact, it's not and I

139
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:09,968
want to show you why. So suppose we have a
PRP that happens to operate on N bits

140
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,259
blocks. And we're going to use this PRP in
CBC mode. So, you know, if there are five

141
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:20,306
blocks in the message then this PRP E will
be called five times to encrypt each one

142
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:24,519
of those blocks. Okay. So here's how the
attack's going to work. Well, the first

143
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,767
thing the adversary is going to do is he's
going to ask for the encryption of the

144
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:32,802
message as 0N, 1N. In other words, the
first block is all zeros and the second

145
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:36,997
block is all ones. So the left message is
equal to the right message here which

146
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:41,458
means that he just wants the encryption of
this 0N, one to the N message. So let's

147
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,784
see what the cipher text looks like. Well,
for completeness I'm gonna write the IV,

148
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:50,077
the fixed IV, as the first element in the
ciphertext. And if you think about how

149
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:54,048
CBC works and the second element in
the ciphertext is gonna be basically the

150
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:58,609
encryption of the IV XOR the first
block of the message. Well in our case the

151
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:02,955
first block of the message is all zeros so
really all we're encrypting is just a

152
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:07,087
fixed IV. So the second block of the
ciphertext is simply gonna be the

153
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:11,112
encryption of this fixed IV. So next, what
the adversary's gonna do is, now he's

154
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:14,845
gonna output two messages that are a
single block. So the first message is

155
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:18,982
gonna be, the message on the left is gonna
be the all zeroes block. And the message

156
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:22,918
on the right is gonna be all ones block.
So observe that this is a valid query,

157
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:26,752
because messages on the left are all
distinct. And the messages on the right

158
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,788
are also all distinct. So these are all
valid deterministic CPA queries. Now, what

159
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:34,471
does the attacker get in response? Well,
what he'll get in response is the

160
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:38,240
following. If he gets the encryption of
the message on the left. Then, well,

161
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,783
what's the encryption of the one block
message, zero to the N? It's simply the

162
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:47,327
encryption of the fixed IV, just as we saw
before. However, if he's getting the

163
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,107
encryption of the message on the right,
well, that's gonna be the encryption of 1 XOR

164
00:11:52,107 --> 00:11:56,671
the fixed IV. That's the definition
of, CBC encryption. So know, you can see

165
00:11:56,671 --> 00:12:00,884
basically how the attack is going to
proceed. You notice, if I, here I'll use a

166
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:05,370
different color here. You notice if these
two blocks happen to be the same, then we

167
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,802
know that he received the encryption of
the message on the left, in other words B

168
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:14,356
is equal to zero. If they're not the same
then he knows that B is equal to one Okay,

169
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:18,885
so he's gonna output zero if, you know, C
of one, which is this block, is equal to

170
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:23,127
C1 of one, which is this block, and he's
gonna output one otherwise. So this

171
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:27,599
basically shows that CBC with a fixed IV
is completely insecure. Basically the

172
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:32,070
first block can be very easily attacked.
And, in fact, if the messages are short

173
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,542
you can again build dictionaries and
completely break systems that kind

174
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:41,185
of view CBC with a fixed IV hoping that
it's gonna be a deterministic CPA secure.

175
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:45,996
So don't do that. We're actually gonna see
secure deterministic CPA constructions in

176
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:50,520
the next segment. So I'll say one more
time, if you need to encrypt the database

177
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,872
index in a consistent manner, don't use
CBC with a fixed IV to do it. Use the

178
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:59,316
schemes that I'm gonna show you in the
next segment. And so let me ask you the

179
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:03,939
same question about counter mode with a
fixed IV. Is this gonna be a deterministic

180
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:08,225
CPA secure system or not? And here, I'm
reminding you what counter mode with a

181
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:12,848
fixed IV is. Basically, we concatenate the
fixed IV. Fixed IV plus one, Fixed IV plus

182
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:17,021
L. We encrypt all these counters. We
concatenate the results, we encrypt the

183
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:21,645
message to get the cipher text. So if you
think this is gonna be deterministic CPA

184
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:26,919
secure. So I hope everybody said no,
because basically this is a onetime

185
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:31,504
padding encryption, and if we use this one
time pad to encrypt distinct messages,

186
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:36,152
basically we'll be getting a two time pad.
And to see more precisely, here I wrote

187
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:40,638
down the, deterministic CPA game. So,
you notice what the attacker will do is he

188
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:45,066
would start off by asking for the
encryption of the message m. So he would

189
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:49,955
get here the message m XOR the encryption
of the fixed iv and then he's gonna ask

190
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:54,555
for some two distinct messages m0 and m1
that's different from m. So, m, m0 and m1

191
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:59,099
are a three are all three are distinct
messages. And then what he'll get is the

192
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:03,527
encryption of mb and now he can simply
mount the standard, kinda two time pad

193
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:09,222
attack. And if this equality here of c XOR c prime is equal to m XOR m zero, he

194
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:14,658
knows that c prime is the encryption of m
zero. And otherwise he knows it's the

195
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:19,348
encryption of M1. So, again, he will
completely win this game with advantage

196
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:23,975
equals to one. Okay, so again deterministic CPA
with a fixed IV is also

197
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:28,411
completely insecure as a deterministic CPA
cipher. So, don't use any of those

198
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:33,482
schemes, instead let's use the schemes I'm
going to describe in the next segment.
