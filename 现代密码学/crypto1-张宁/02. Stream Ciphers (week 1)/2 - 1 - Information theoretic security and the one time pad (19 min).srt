1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,262
Now that we've seen a few examples of
historic ciphers, all of which are badly

2
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:07,130
broken, we're going to switch gears and
talk about ciphers that are much better

3
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:13,115
designed. But before we do that, I want to,
first of all, define more precisely what a

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:17,432
cipher is. So first of all, a cipher is
actually, remember a cipher is made up of

5
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:21,694
two algorithms. There's an encryption
algorithm and a decryption algorithm. But

6
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:26,012
in fact, a cipher is defined over a
triple. So the set of all possible keys,

7
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:31,292
which I'm going to denote by script K, and
sometimes I'll call this the key space,

8
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:35,968
it's the set of all possible keys. There's
this set of all possible messages and this

9
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:40,365
set of all possible ciphertexts. Okay, so
this triple in some sense defines the

10
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:44,756
environment over which the cipher is
defined. And then the cipher itself is a

11
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:49,236
pair of efficient algorithms E and D. E is
the encryption algorithm; D is the

12
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:57,762
decryption algorithm. Of course, E takes
keys and messages. And outputs ciphertexts.

13
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:06,770
And the decryption algorithm takes
keys and ciphertexts. Then outputs messages.

14
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,282
And the only requirements is that these
algorithms are consistent. They satisfy

15
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:17,933
what's called the correctness property. So
for every message in the message space.

16
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:23,593
And every key. In the key space, it had
better be the case that if I encrypt the

17
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:29,185
message with the key K and then I decrypt
using the same key K I had better get back

18
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:34,711
the original message that I started with.
So this equation here is what's called the

19
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:39,974
consistency equation and every cipher has
to satisfy it in order to be a cipher

20
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:44,970
otherwise it's not possible to decrypt.
One thing I wanted to point out is that I

21
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,782
put the word efficient here in quotes. And
the reason I do that is because efficient

22
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:54,041
means different things to different
people. If you're more inclined towards

23
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:58,811
theory, efficient means runs in polynomial
time. So algorithms E and D have to run in

24
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:02,842
polynomial time in the size of their
inputs. If you're more practically

25
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:07,045
inclined, efficient means runs within a
certain time period. So for example,

26
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:11,474
algorithm E might be required to take
under a minute to encrypt a gigabyte of

27
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:16,073
data. Now either way, the word efficient
kind of captures both notions and you can

28
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:20,158
interpret it in your head whichever way
you'd like. I'm just going to keep

29
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:24,139
referring to it as efficient and put
quotes in it as I said if you're theory

30
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:27,964
inclined think of it as polynomial time,
otherwise think of it as

31
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:32,100
concrete time constraints. Another comment
I want to make is in fact algorithm E.

32
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,455
It's often a randomized algorithm. What
that means is that as your encrypting

33
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:40,981
messages, algorithm E is gonna generate
random bits for itself, and it's going to

34
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:45,676
use those random bits to actually encrypt
the messages that are given to it. On the

35
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:50,258
other hand the decrypting algorithm is
always deterministic. In other words given

36
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:54,558
the key and the ciphertext output is
always the same. Doesn't depend on any

37
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:58,970
randomness that's used by the algorithm.
Okay, so now that we understand what a

38
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,552
cipher is better, I want to kind of show
you the first example of a secure cipher.

39
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,364
It's called a one time pad It was designed
by Vernam back at the beginning of the

40
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:12,724
twentieth century. Before I actually
explain what the cipher is, let's just

41
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:17,383
state it in the terminology that we've
just seen. So the message space for the

42
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:22,221
Vernam cipher for the one-time pad is the
same as the ciphertext space which is

43
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:27,653
just the set of all ended binary strings.
This, this just means all sequences of

44
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:33,854
bits, of zero one characters. The key
space is basically the same as the message

45
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:40,134
space which is again simply the embed of
all binary strings. So a key in the one

46
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:46,290
time pad is simply a random big string,
it's a random sequence of bits. That's as

47
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,508
long as the message to be encrypted, as
long as the message. Okay, now that we've

48
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:56,726
specified kind of what's the cipher's
defined over we can actually specify how

49
00:03:56,726 --> 00:04:02,010
the cipher works and it's actually really
simple. So essentially the ciphertexts.

50
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,812
Which is the result of encrypting a
message with a particular key, is simply

51
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:13,766
the XOR of the two. Simply K XOR M. [inaudible] see a quick example of

52
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:20,026
this. Remember that XOR, this plus
with a circle. XOR means addition

53
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:26,825
modulo two. So if I take a particular
message, say, 0110111. And it take a

54
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:33,871
particular key, say 1011001. When I
compute the encryption of the message

55
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:38,838
using this key, all I do is I
compute the XOR of these two

56
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:43,942
strings. In other words, I do addition
module or two bit by bit. So I get one,

57
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:48,645
one, zero, one, one, one, zero. That's a
ciphertext. And then how do I decrypt? I

58
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:52,893
guess they could do kind of the same
thing. So they decrypt a cipher text using

59
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:57,248
a particular key. What I do is I XOR the
key and the ciphertext again. And so all

60
00:04:57,248 --> 00:05:01,819
we have to verify is that it satisfies the
consistency requirements. And I'm going to

61
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:06,443
do this slowly once and then from now on
I'm going to assume this is all, simple to

62
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:10,798
you. So we're gonna make, we're gonna have
to make sure that if I decrypt a cipher

63
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:14,893
text, that was encrypted using a
particular key, I had better get. Back the

64
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:20,481
message M. So what happens here? Well,
let's see. So if I look at the encryption

65
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:25,996
of k and m, this is just k XOR m by
definition. What's the decryption of k XOR

66
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:31,628
m using k? That's just k XOR (k XOR
m). And so since I said that XOR is

67
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:36,948
addition modulo two, addition is
associative, so this is the same as (k XOR k)

68
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:43,007
XOR m, which is simply as you know k XOR k is a zero, and zero XOR anything

69
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:49,066
is simply m. Okay, so this actually shows
that the one-time pad is in fact a cipher,

70
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:54,277
but it doesn't say anything about the
security of the cipher. And we'll talk

71
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:58,319
about security of the cipher in just a
minute. First of all, let me quickly ask

72
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,205
you a question, just to make sure we're
all in sync. Suppose you are given a

73
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:06,092
message m and the encryption of that
message using the one time pad. So all

74
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:10,522
you're given is the message and the cipher
text. My question to you is, given this

75
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:15,467
pair m and c, can you actually figure out
the one-time pad key that was used in the

76
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:20,588
creation of c from m?

77
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,030
So I hope all of you
realize that in fact, given the message in

78
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,473
the cipher text it's very easy to recover
what the key is. In particular the key is

79
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:30,241
simply M XOR C. Then we'll see that if
it's not immediately obvious to you we'll

80
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:35,238
see why that's, the case, a little later
in the talk, in the lecture. Okay alright

81
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:40,198
so the 1-time pad is a really cool from a
performance point of view all you're doing

82
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:44,656
is you exo-ring the key in the message so
it's a super, super fast. Cypher for

83
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:48,464
encrypting and decrypting very long
messages. Unfortunately it's very

84
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:52,768
difficult to use in practice. The reason
it's difficult to use is the keys are

85
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:56,907
essentially as long as the message. So if
Alice and Bob want to communicate

86
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:01,321
securely, so you know Alice wants to send
a message end to Bob, before she begins

87
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:06,011
even sending the first bit of the message,
she has to transmit a key to Bob that's as

88
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:10,536
long as that message. Well, if she has a
way to transmit a secure key to Bob that's

89
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:15,061
as long as the message, she might as well
use that same mechanism to also transmit

90
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:19,439
the message itself. So the fact that the
key is as long as the message is quite

91
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,490
problematic and makes the one-time pad
very difficult to use in practice.

92
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,040
Although we'll see that the idea behind
the one-time pad is actually quite useful

93
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,590
and we'll see that a little bit later. But
for now I want to focus a little bit on

94
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,918
security. So the obvious questions are,
you know, why is the one-time pad secure?

95
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,195
Why is it a good cypher? Then to answer
that question, the first thing we have to

96
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:45,191
answer is, what is a secure cipher to
begin with? What is a, what makes cipher

97
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:49,759
secure? Okay, so the study, security of
ciphers, we have to talk a little bit

98
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,962
about information theory. And in fact the
first person, to study security of ciphers

99
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,076
rigorously. Is very famous, you know, the
father of information theory, Claude

100
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:05,042
Shannon, and he published a famous paper
back in 1949 where he analyzes the

101
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:10,603
security of the one-time pad. So the idea
behind Shannon's definition of security is

102
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:15,182
the following. Basically, if all you get
to see is the cypher text, then you should

103
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:19,379
learn absolutely nothing about the plain
text. In other words, the cypher text

104
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,413
should reveal no information about the
plain text. And you see why it took

105
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:28,047
someone who invented information theory to
come up with this notion because you have

106
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:32,517
to formulize, formally explain what does
information about the plain text actually

107
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:37,653
mean. Okay so that's what Shannon did and
so lemme show you Shannon's definition,

108
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:42,841
I'll, I'll write it out slowly first. So
what Shannon said is you know suppose we

109
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:48,029
have a cypher E D that's defined over
triple K M and C just as before. So KM and

110
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:53,411
C define the key space, the message space
and the cypher text space. And when we say

111
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:58,404
that the cypher text sorry we say that the
cypher has perfect secrecy if the

112
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:03,592
following condition holds. It so happens
for every two messages M zero and M1 in

113
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:08,684
the message space. For every two messages
the only requirement I'm gonna put on

114
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:13,831
these messages is they have the same
length. Yeah so we're only, we'll see why

115
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:19,106
this requirement is necessary in just a
minute. And for every cyphertext, in the

116
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:25,221
cyphertext space. Okay? So for every pair
of method messages and for every cipher

117
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:31,118
text, it had better be the case that, if I
ask, what is the probability that,

118
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:37,096
encrypting N zero with K, woops.
Encrypting N zero with K gives C, okay? So

119
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:43,551
how likely is it, if we pick a random key?
How likely is it that when we encrypt N

120
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:49,819
zero, we get C. That probability should be
the same as when we encrypt N1. Okay, so

121
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:54,920
the probability of encrypting n one and
getting c is exactly the same as the

122
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,955
probability of encrypting n zero and
getting c. And just as I said where the

123
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:04,658
key, the distribution, is over the
distribution on the key. So, the key is

124
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:10,157
uniform in the key space. So k is uniform
in k. And I'm often going to write k arrow

125
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:15,390
with a little r above it to denote the
fact that k is a random variable that's

126
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,491
uniformly sampled in the key space k.
Okay, this is the main part of Shannon's

127
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:25,892
definition. And let's think a little bit
about what this definition actually says.

128
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:30,965
So what does it mean that these two
probabilities are the same? Well, what it

129
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:36,304
says is that if I'm an attacker and I
intercept a particular cypher text c, then

130
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:41,577
in reality, the probability that the
cypher text is the encryption of n zero is

131
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:46,798
exactly the same as the probability that
it's the incryption of n one. Because

132
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:52,219
those probabilities are equal. So if I
have, all I have the cypher text C that's

133
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:57,639
all I have intercepted I have no idea
whether the cypher text came from M zero

134
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,196
or the cypher text came from M one because
again the probability of getting C is

135
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:08,651
equally likely whether M zero is being
encrypted or M one is being encrypted. So

136
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:13,286
here, we have the definition stated again.
And I just wanna write these properties

137
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:17,749
again more precisely. So let's write this
again. So what [inaudible] definition

138
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:22,326
means is that if I am given a particular
cipher text, I can't tell where it came

139
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:27,125
from. I can't tell if it's, if the message
that was encrypted. Is either N zero or N

140
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:32,090
one and in fact, this property is true for
all messages. For all these N zero, for

141
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:37,117
all N zero and N ones. So not only can I
not tell if'c' came from N zero or N one,

142
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:42,144
I can't tell if it came from N two or N
three or N four or N five because all of

143
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:47,109
them are equally likely to produce the
cypher text'c'. So what this means really

144
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:52,074
is that if you're encrypting messages with
a one time pad then in fact the most

145
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:56,729
powerful adversary, I don't really care
how smart you are, the most powerful

146
00:11:56,729 --> 00:12:02,530
adversary. Can learn nothing about the
plain text, learns nothing about the plain

147
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:09,624
text. From the cypher text. So to say it
in one more way, basically what this

148
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:16,315
proves is that there's no, there's no
cypher text-only attack on a cypher that

149
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:23,263
has perfect secrecy. Now, cypher attacks
actually aren't the only attacks possible.

150
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:29,440
And in fact, other attacks may be
possible, other attacks may be possible.

151
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,772
Okay. Now that we understand what perfect
secrecy, means, the question is, can we

152
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:41,327
build ciphers that actually have perfect
secrecy? And it turns out that we don't

153
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,517
have to look very far, the one time
pattern fact has perfect secrecy. So I

154
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:50,719
want to prove to you this is Shannon's first
results and I wanna prove this fact to

155
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:55,858
you, it's very simple proof so let's go
ahead and look at it and just do it. So we

156
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:01,061
need to kind of interpret what does that
mean, what is this probability that E K M

157
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:06,200
Z is equal to C. So it's actually not that
hard to see that for every message and

158
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,022
every cyphertext the probability that the
encryption of N under a key K the

159
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:16,161
probability that, that's equal to C, the
probability that our random choice of key

160
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:23,720
by definition. All that is, is basically
the number of keys. Kay, instruct Kay.

161
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:31,533
Such that, well. If I encrypt. And with k
I get c. So I literally count the number

162
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:37,207
of keys and I divide by the total number
of keys. Right? That's what it means, that

163
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:42,833
if I choose a random key, that key maps m
to c. Right. So it's basically the number

164
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:47,707
of key that map n to c divided by the
total number of keys. This is its

165
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:53,406
probability. So now suppose that we had a
cypher such that for all messages and all

166
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:58,967
cypher texts, it so happens that if I look
at this number, the number of k, k, and k,

167
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:04,391
such that e, k, m is equal to c. In other
words, I'm looking at the number of keys

168
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:09,259
that map m to c. Suppose this number
happens to be a constant. So say it

169
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:14,079
happens to be two, three, or ten or
fifteen. It just hap, happens to be an

170
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,332
absolute constance. If that's the case,
then by definition, for all n0 and n1 and

171
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:24,747
for all c, this probability has to be the
same because the denominator is the same,

172
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:30,097
the numerator is the same, it's just as
constant, and therefore the probability is

173
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:35,644
always the same for all n and c. And so if
this property is true, then the cypher has

174
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:43,616
to have, the cypher has perfect secrecy.
Okay, so lets see what can we say about

175
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:48,804
this quantity for the one time pad. So the
sec-, so, the question to you is, if I

176
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:54,770
have a message in a cipher-text, how many
one time pad keys are there [inaudible]

177
00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:00,381
map, this message ends, so the [inaudible]
C? So, in other words, how many keys are

178
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:06,101
there, such that M XOR K is equal to C?
So I hope you've all answered one. And

179
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:12,683
let's see why that's the case. For the one
time pad, if we have that, the encryption

180
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:18,303
of K of M under K is equal to C. But
basically, well, by definition, that

181
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:24,885
implies that K XOR M is equal to C. But
that also simply says that K has to equal

182
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:31,766
to M XOR C. Yes, I just X over both
sides by M and I get that K must equal the

183
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:37,561
M XOR C. Okay? So what that says is
that, for the one time pad, in fact, the

184
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:43,707
number of keys, in K, shows the EKM, is
equal to C. That simply is one, and this

185
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:49,852
holds for all messages in cipher text. And
so, again, by what we said before, it just

186
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:54,987
says that the one time pad has, perfect
secrecy. Perfect secrecy and that

187
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,093
completes the proof of this [inaudible]
very, very simple. Very, very simple

188
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:03,644
lemma. Now the funny thing is that
even though this lemma is so simple to

189
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:08,194
prove in fact it proves a pretty powerful
statement again. This basically says for

190
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:12,328
the one time [inaudible] there is no
cypher text only attack. So, unlike the

191
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:16,393
substitution cipher, or the vigenere
cipher, or the roller machines, all those

192
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:20,778
could be broken by ciphertext-only attack.
We've just proved that for the one-time

193
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:25,110
pad, that's simply impossible. Given the
cyphertext, you simply learn nothing about

194
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,281
the plaintext. However, as we can see,
this is simply not the end of the story. I

195
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:33,131
mean, are we done? I mean, basically,
we're done with the course now, cuz we

196
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:37,359
have a way. To encrypt, so that an
attacker can't recover anything about our

197
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:41,206
method. So maybe we're done with the
course. But in fact, as we'll see, there

198
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:45,261
are other attacks. And, in fact, the one
time pad is actually not such a

199
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:49,316
secure cipher. And in fact, there are
other attacks that are possible, and we'll

200
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:54,075
see that shortly. Okay? I emphasize again
the fact that it has perfect secrecy does

201
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:58,785
not mean that the one time pad is the
secure cypher to use. Okay. But as we said

202
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:03,733
the problem with the one time pad is that
the secret key is really long. If you had

203
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:08,071
a way of. Communicating the secret key
over to the other side. You might as well

204
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:12,253
use that exact same method to also
communicate the message to the other side,

205
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:16,652
in which case you wouldn't need a cypher
to begin with. Okay? So the problem again

206
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:21,105
is the one time pad had really long keys
and so the obvious question is are there

207
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:25,450
other cyphers that has perfect secrecy and
possibly have much, much shorter keys?

208
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,136
Well, so the bad news is the Shannon,
after proving that the one-time pad has

209
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:34,945
perfect secrecy, proved another theorem
that says that in fact if a cypher has

210
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:39,878
perfect secrecy, the number of keys in the
cypher must be at least the number of

211
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:44,935
messages that the cypher can handle. Okay,
so in particular, what this means is if I

212
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:51,037
have perfect secrecy. Then necessarily the
number of keys, or rather the length of my

213
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:56,309
key, must be greater than the length of
the message. So, in fact, since the one

214
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,834
time pad satisfies us with equality, the
one time pad is an optimal, cipher that

215
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:04,862
has perfect secrecy, okay? So basically,
what this shows is that this is an

216
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:09,056
interesting notion. The one time pad is an
interesting cipher. But, in fact, in

217
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:13,360
reality, it's actually quite hard to use.
It's hard to use in practice, again,

218
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,790
because of these long keys. And so this
notion of perfect secrecy, even though

219
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,840
it's quite interesting, basically says
that it doesn't really tell us the

220
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,279
practical cyphers are going to be secure.
And we're gonna see, but, as we said, the

221
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,994
idea behind the one time pad is quite good.
And we're gonna see, in the next lecture,

222
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:33,547
how to make that into a practical
system.
