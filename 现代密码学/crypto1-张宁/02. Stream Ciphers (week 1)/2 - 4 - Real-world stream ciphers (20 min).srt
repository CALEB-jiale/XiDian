1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,010
In this segment, I want to give a few
examples of stream ciphers that are used in practice.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,072
I'm gonna start with two old
examples that actually are not

3
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:11,017
supposed to be used in new systems.
But nevertheless, they're still fairly

4
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:14,164
widely used, and so I just want to mention
the names so that you're familiar with

5
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:19,087
these concepts. The first stream cipher I
want to talk about is called RC4, designed

6
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:23,429
back in 1987. And I'm only gonna give you
the high-level description of it, and then

7
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,818
we'll talk about some weaknesses of RC4
and leave it at that. So RC4 takes a

8
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:32,702
variable size seed, here I just gave
as an example where it would take 128

9
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:36,980
bits as the seed size, which would then
be used as the key for the stream cipher.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,738
The first thing it does, is it expands the
128-bit secret key into 2,048 bits, which

11
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:46,382
are gonna be used as the internal state
for the generator. And then, once it's done

12
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:51,197
this expansion, it basically executes a
very simple loop, where every iteration of

13
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:55,898
this loop outputs one byte of output. So,
essentially, you can run the generator for

14
00:00:55,898 --> 00:01:00,653
as long as you want, and generate one byte
at a time. Now RC4 is actually, as I said,

15
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:05,205
fairly popular. It's used in the HTTPS
protocol quite commonly actually.

16
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:11,888
These days, for example, Google uses RC4 in its
HTTPS. It's also used in WEP as we

17
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:15,686
discussed in the last segment, but of
course in WEP, it's used incorrectly and

18
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:18,861
it's completely insecure the way it's used
inside of WEP. So over the years,

19
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:23,886
some weaknesses have been found in RC4, and as a
result, it's recommended that new projects

20
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:28,793
actually not use RC4 but rather use a more
modern pseudo-random generator as we'll

21
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:34,059
discuss toward the end of the segment. So
let me just mention two of the weaknesses.

22
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:39,561
So the first one is, it's kind of bizarre
basically, if you look at the second byte

23
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:44,630
of the output of RC4. It turns out the
second byte is slightly biased. If RC4 was

24
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,780
completely random, the probability that the
second byte happens to be equal to zero

25
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,744
would be exactly one over 256. There are
256 possible bytes, the probability that

26
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:59,646
it's zero should be one over 256. It so
happens that for RC4 the probability is

27
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:04,486
actually two over 256, which means that if
you use the RC4 output to encrypt a

28
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:09,574
message the second byte is likely to not
be encrypted at all. In other words it'll

29
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:14,575
be XOR-ed with zero with twice the
probability that it's supposed to.

30
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:19,436
So two over 256, instead of one over 256.
And by the way I should say that there's

31
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:22,849
nothing special about the second byte. It
turns out the first and the third bytes

32
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,818
are also biased. And in fact it's now
recommended that if you're gonna use RC4,

33
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:32,800
what you should do is ignore basically the
first 256 bytes of the output and just

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,246
start using the output of the generator
starting from byte 257. The first couple

35
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:41,241
of bytes turned out to be biased, so you
just ignore them. The second attack that

36
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:48,482
was discovered is that in fact if you look
at a very long output of RC4 it so happens

37
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:53,863
that you're more likely to get the
sequence 00. In other words, you're more

38
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:58,970
likely to get sixteen bits, two bytes of
zero, zero, than you should. Again, if RC4

39
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,948
was completely random the probability of
seeing zero, zero would be exactly 1/256

40
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:08,556
squared. It turns out RC4 is a little
biased and the bias is 1/256 cubed. It

41
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:13,718
turns out this bias actually starts after
several gigabytes of data are produced by

42
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:18,634
RC4. But nevertheless, this is something
that can be used to predict the generator

43
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:23,120
and definitely it can be used to
distinguish the output of the generator

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,097
from a truly random sequence. Basically the
fact that zero, zero appears more often

45
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:32,414
than it should is the distinguisher. And
then in the last segment we talked about

46
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:36,313
related-key attacks that were used to
attack WEP, that basically say that

47
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:41,078
if one uses keys that are closely related
to one another then it's actually possible

48
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:45,732
to recover the root key. So these are the
weaknesses that are known of RC4 and, as a

49
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:50,217
result, it's recommended that new systems
actually not use RC4 and instead use a

50
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:54,421
modern pseudo-random generator. Okay,
second example I want to give you is a

51
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:59,131
badly broken stream cipher that's used for
encrypting DVD movies. When you buy a DVD

52
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:03,504
in the store, the actual movie is
encrypted using a stream cipher called the

53
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:07,933
content scrambling system, CSS. CSS turns
out to be a badly broken stream cipher,

54
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:12,523
and we can very easily break it, and I
want to show you how the attack algorithm

55
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:16,894
works. We're doing it so you can see an
example of an attack algorithm, but in

56
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:21,435
fact, there are many systems out there
that basically use this attack to decrypt

57
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:25,749
encrypted DVDs. So the CSS stream cipher
is based on something that hardware

58
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:30,291
designers like. It's designed to be a
hardware stream cipher that is supposed to

59
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:34,491
be easy to implement in hardware, and is
based on a mechanism called a linear

60
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:38,749
feedback shift register. So a linear
feedback shift register is basically a register

61
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:43,801
that consists of cells where
each cell contains one bit. Then basically

62
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:49,046
what happens is there are these taps into
certain cells, not all the cells, certain

63
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:54,134
positions are called taps. And then these
taps feed into an XOR and then at

64
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:59,053
every clock cycle, the shift register
shifts to the left. The last bit falls off

65
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:04,345
and then the first bit becomes the result
of this XOR. So you can see that

66
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:08,703
this is a very simple mechanism to implement, and in hardware takes very few

67
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:13,622
transistors. Just the shift right, the
last bit falls off and the first bit just

68
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:18,541
becomes the XOR of the previous
bits. So the seed for this LFSR

69
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:23,460
basically, is the initial state of the
LFSR.

70
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,538
And it is the basis of a number of stream
ciphers. So here are some examples. So, as

71
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:33,362
I said, DVD encryption uses two LFSRs.
I'll show you how that works in just a

72
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:38,060
second. GSM encryption, these are
algorithms called A51 and A52. And that

73
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,456
uses three LFSRs. Bluetooth encryption is
an algorithm called, E zero. These are all

74
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:48,534
stream ciphers, and that uses four LFSRs.
Turns out all of these are badly broken,

75
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:53,245
and actually really should not be trusted
for encrypting traffic, but they're all

76
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:56,705
implemented in hardware, so it's a little
difficult now to change what the hardware

77
00:05:56,705 --> 00:06:01,047
does. But the simplest of these, CSS,
actually has a cute attack on it, so let

78
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:05,459
me show you how the attack works. So,
let's describe how CSS actually works. So,

79
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:11,073
the key for CSS is five bytes, namely 40
bits, five times eight is 40 bits. The

80
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:15,587
reason they had to limit themselves to
only 40 bits is that DVD encryption was

81
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:19,941
designed at a time where U.S. Export
regulations only allowed for export of

82
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:25,086
crpyto algorithms where the key was
only 40 bits. So the designers of CSS were

83
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:30,206
already limited to very, very short keys.
Just 40 bit keys. So, their design works

84
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:35,398
as follows. Basically, CSS uses two
LFSR's. One is a 17-bit LFSR. In other words,

85
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:40,806
the register contains
17 bits. And the other one is a 25-bit LFSR,

86
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:46,647
it's a little bit longer, 25-bit
LFSR. And the way these LFSRs are seeded

87
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:51,870
is as follows. So the key for the
encryption, basically looks as follows.

88
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:57,669
You start off with a one, and you concatenate to it the first two bytes of

89
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:02,947
the key. And that's the initial state of the LFSR.

90
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:08,256
And then the second LFSR basically is intitialized the same way.

91
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:14,012
One concatenated the last three bytes of
the key. And that's

92
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:19,889
loaded into the initial state of the LFSR.
You can see that the first two bytes are

93
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,411
sixteen bits, plus leading one, that's
seventeen bits overall, whereas the second

94
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:31,217
LFSR is 24 bits plus one which is 25 bits.
And you notice we used all five bits of

95
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:36,881
the key. So then these LFSRs are basically
run for eight cycles, so they generate

96
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:42,333
eight bits of output. And then they go
through this adder that does basically

97
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:48,197
addition modulo 256. Yeah so this is an
addition box, modulo 256. There's one more

98
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:54,325
technical thing that happens. In fact let's
actually—also added is the carry from the

99
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:59,723
previous block. But that is not so
important. That's a detail that's not so

100
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:04,761
relevant. OK, so every block, you notice
we're doing addition modulo 256 and

101
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:09,982
we're ignoring the carry, but the carry is
basically added as a zero or a one to the

102
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:15,147
addition of the next block. Okay? And then
basically this output one byte per round.

103
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:20,411
Okay, and then this byte is then of course
used, XOR-ed with the appropriate

104
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:25,167
byte of the movie that's being encrypted.
Okay, so it's a very simple stream

105
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:29,986
cipher, it takes very little hardware to
implement. It will run fast, even on very

106
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:35,830
cheap hardware and it will encrypt movies.
So it turns out this is easy to break

107
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:41,222
in time roughly two to the seventeen. Now let me show you how.

108
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:45,734
So suppose you
intercept the movies, so here we have an

109
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:50,647
encrypted movie that you want to decrypt.
So let's say that this is all encrypted so

110
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:55,279
you have no idea what's inside of here.
However, it so happens that just because

111
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,970
DVD encryption is using MPEG files, it so
happens if you know of a prefix of the

112
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,250
plaintext, let's just say maybe this is
twenty bytes. Well, we know if you

113
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,589
XOR these two things together, so in other words, you do the XOR here,

114
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,523
what you'll get is the initial segment of the PRG. So, you'll get the

115
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:18,472
first twenty bytes of the output of CSS,
the output of this PRG. Okay, so now

116
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:23,986
here's what we're going to do. So we have
the first twenty bytes of the output. Now

117
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:31,405
we do the following. We try all two to the
seventeen possible values of the first

118
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:37,088
LFSR. Okay? So two to the seventeen
possible values. So for each value, so for

119
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:42,622
each of these two to the seventeen initial
values of the LFSR, we're gonna run the

120
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:47,953
LFSR for twenty bytes, okay? So we'll
generate twenty bytes of outputs from this

121
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:53,284
first LFSR, assuming—for each one of the
two to the seventeen possible settings.

122
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:58,615
Now, remember we have the full output of
the CSS system. So what we can do is we

123
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:03,814
can take this output that we have. And
subtract it from the twenty bites that we

124
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:08,928
got from the first LFSR, and if in fact our
guess for the initial state of the first

125
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:14,042
LFSR is correct, what we should get
is the first twenty-byte output of the

126
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:19,222
second LFSR. Right? Because that's by
definition what the output of the CSS

127
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:24,501
system is. Now, it turns out that looking
at a 20-byte sequence, it's very easy

128
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:29,763
to tell whether this 20-byte sequence
came from a 25-bit LFSR or not. If it

129
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:33,561
didn't, then we know that our guess
for the 17-bit LFSR was

130
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:37,416
incorrect and then we move on to the next
guess for the 17-bit LFSR and

131
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:41,904
the next guess and so on and so forth.
Until eventually we hit the right initial

132
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:46,937
state for the 17-bit LFSR, and
then we'll actually get, we'll see that

133
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:51,969
the 20 bytes that we get as the
candidate output for the 25-bit LFSR is

134
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:56,936
in fact a possible output for a 25-bit LFSR. And then, not only will we have

135
00:10:56,936 --> 00:11:02,164
learned the correct initial state for the
17-bit LFSR, we will have also

136
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:07,523
learned the correct initial state of the
25-bit LFSR. And then we can predict the

137
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:12,796
remaining outputs of CSS, and of course,
using that, we can then decrypt the rest of

138
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:17,565
the movie. We can actually recover the
remaining plaintext. Okay. This is

139
00:11:17,565 --> 00:11:22,335
things that we talked about before. So, I
said this a little quick, but hopefully,

140
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:27,331
it was clear. We're also going to be doing
a homework exercise on this type of stream

141
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:31,444
ciphers and you'll kind of get the point
of how these attack algorithms

142
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:36,018
work. And I should mention that there are
many open-source systems now that actually

143
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:41,453
use this method to decrypt CSS-encrypted
data. Okay, so now that we've seen two

144
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:45,888
weak examples, let's move on to better
examples, and in particular the better

145
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:49,370
pseudo-random generators come from what's
called the eStream Project. This is a

146
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,556
project that concluded in 2008, and they
qualify basically five different stream

147
00:11:55,556 --> 00:12:00,207
ciphers, but here I want to present just
one. So first of all the parameters for

148
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:04,029
these stream ciphers are a little
different than what we're used to. So these

149
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:08,340
stream ciphers as normal they have a seed.
But in addition they also have, what's

150
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,821
called a nonce and we'll see what a
nonce is used for in just a minute. So

151
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:17,487
they take two inputs a seed and a nonce.
We'll see what the nonce is used for in

152
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:21,274
just a second. And the of course they
produce a very large output, so n here is

153
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:26,603
much, much, much bigger than s. Now, when
I say nonce, what I mean is a value that's

154
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:31,218
never going to repeat as long as the key
is fixed. And I'll explain that in more

155
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:35,400
detail in just a second. But for now, just
think of it as a unique value that never

156
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,527
repeats as long as the key is the same.
And so of course once you have this PRG,

157
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:45,357
you would encrypt, you get a stream cipher
just as before, except now as you see, the

158
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:49,955
PRG takes as input both the key and the
nonce. And the property of the nonce is

159
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:56,350
that the pair, k comma r, so the key comma
the nonce, is never—never repeats. It's

160
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:03,096
never used more than once. So the bottom
line is that you can reuse the key, reuse

161
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:09,710
the key, because the nonce makes the
pair unique, because k and r are only

162
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:16,135
used once. I'll say they're unique. Okay
so this nonce is kind of a cute trick that

163
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:21,541
saves us the trouble of moving to a new
key every time. Okay, so the particular

164
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:26,000
example from the eStream that I want to
show you is called Salsa twenty. It's a

165
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,292
stream cipher that's designed for both
software implementations and hardware

166
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,385
implementations. It's kind of interesting.
You realize that some stream ciphers are

167
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:38,763
designed for software, like RC4.
Everything it does is designed to make

168
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:42,689
software implementation run fast, whereas
other stream ciphers are designed for

169
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:48,143
hardware, like CSS, using an LFSR that's
particularly designed to make hardware

170
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:50,963
implementations very cheap. It's also, the
nice thing about that is that it's

171
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:55,008
designed so that it's both easy to
implement it in hardware and its software

172
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:59,747
implementation is also very fast. So let
me explain how Salsa works. Well, Salsa

173
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:05,130
takes either 128 or 256-bit keys. I'll
only explain the 128-bit version of Salsa.

174
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,244
So this is the seed. And then it also
takes a nonce, just as before, which

175
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:15,425
happens to be 64 bits. And then it'll
generate a large output. Now, how does it

176
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:21,060
actually work? Well, the function itself
is defined as follows. Basically, given

177
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,378
the key and the nonce, it will generate a
very long, well, a long pseudorandom

178
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:31,222
sequence, as long as necessary. And it'll do
it by using this function that I'll denote by

179
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:35,653
H. This function H takes three inputs.
Basically the key. Well, the seed k,

180
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:40,498
the nonce r, and then a counter that
increments from step to step. So it goes

181
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:45,263
from zero to one, two, three, four as long as
we need it to be. Okay? So basically,

182
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:49,956
by evaluating this H on this k r, but using
this incrementing counter, we can get a

183
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:54,882
sequence that's as long as we want. So all
I have to do is describe how this function

184
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:59,460
H works. Now, let me do that here for you.
The way it works is as follows. Well, we

185
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,693
start off by expanding the states into
something quite large which is 64 bytes

186
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:10,156
long, and we do that as follows. Basically
we stick a constant at the beginning, so

187
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:15,552
there's tao zero, these are four bytes,
it's a four byte constant, so the spec for

188
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:20,611
Salsa basically gives you the value for
tao zero. Then we put k in which is

189
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:25,467
sixteen bytes. Then we put another
constant. Again, this is four bytes. And

190
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:30,795
as I said, the spec basically specifies
what this fixed constant is. Then we put

191
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:37,435
the nonce, which is eight bytes. Then we
put the index. This is the counter zero,

192
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:43,063
one, two, three, four, which is another
eight bytes. Then we put another constant

193
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:49,056
tau two, which is another four bytes.
Then we put the key again, this is another

194
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:54,714
sixteen bytes. And then finally we put the
third constant, tau three, which is

195
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:59,948
another four bytes. Okay so as I said, if you
sum these up, you see that you get 64

196
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:05,249
bytes. So basically we've expanded the key
and the nonce and the counter into 64

197
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:10,886
bytes. Basically the key is repeated twice
I guess. And then what we do is we apply a

198
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:16,321
function, I'll call this functional little h.
Okay, so we apply this function, little h.

199
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:21,659
And this is a function that's one to one
so it maps 64 bytes to 64 bytes. It's a

200
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:26,005
completely invertible function, okay? So
this function h is, as I say, it's an

201
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:30,260
invertable function. So given the input
you can get the output and given the

202
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,906
output you can go back to the input. And
it's designed specifically so it's a- easy

203
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:39,553
to implement in hardware and b- on an x86,
it's extremely easy to implement because

204
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:44,199
x86 has this SSE2 instruction set which
supports all the operations you need to do

205
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:48,622
for this function. It's very, very fast.
As a result, Salsa has a very fast stream

206
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:52,764
cipher. And then it does this basically
again and again. So it applies this

207
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:57,744
function h again and it gets another 64
bytes. And so on and so forth, basically

208
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:05,318
it does this ten times. Okay so the whole
thing here, say repeats ten times, so

209
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:17,961
basically apply h ten times. And then by
itself, this is actually not quite random.

210
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:22,144
It's not gonna look random because like we
said, H is completely invertable. So given

211
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:25,521
this final output, it's very easy to
just invert h and then go back to the original

212
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:31,831
inputs and then test that the input has
the right structure. So you do one more

213
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:36,979
thing, which is to basically XOR the
inputs and the final outputs. Actually,

214
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:42,405
sorry. It's not an XOR. It's actually an
addition. So you do an addition word by

215
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:47,762
word. So if there are 64 bytes, you do a
word-by-word addition four bytes at a

216
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:52,980
time, and finally you get the 64-byte
output, and that's it. That's the whole

217
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,175
pseudo-random generator. So that, that's
the whole function, little h. And as I

218
00:17:57,175 --> 00:18:01,758
explained, this whole construction here is
the function big H. And then you evaluate

219
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:06,009
big H by incrementing the counter I from
zero, one, two, three onwards. And that

220
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:10,408
will give you a pseudo-random sequence
that's as long as you need it to be. And

221
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:15,325
basically, there are no signifigant
attacks on this. This has security that's

222
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:20,371
very close to two to the 128. We'll see
what that means more precisely later on.

223
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:25,417
It's a very fast stream cipher, both in
hardware and in software. And, as far as

224
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:30,431
we can tell, it seems to be unpredictable
as required for a stream cipher. So I

225
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:34,797
should say that the eStream project
actually has five stream ciphers like

226
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:39,395
this. I only chose Salsa 'cause I think
it's the most elegant. But I can give you

227
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:44,053
some performance numbers here. So you can
see, these are performance numbers on a

228
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:48,768
2.2 gigahertz, you know, x86 type machine.
And you can see that RC4 actually is the

229
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:53,017
slowest. Because essentially, well it
doesn't really take advantage of the

230
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:57,475
hardware. It only does byte operations.
And so there's a lot of wasted cycles that

231
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:01,182
aren't being used. But the E-Stream
candidates, both Salsa and other

232
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:05,202
candidate called Sosemanuk. I should say these
are eStream finalists. These are

233
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:09,588
actually stream ciphers that are approved
by the eStream project. You can see that

234
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:13,712
they have achieved a significant rate.
This is 643 megabytes per second on this

235
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:18,150
architecture, more than enough for a movie
and these are actually quite impressive

236
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,432
rates. And so now you've seen examples of
two old stream ciphers that shouldn't be

237
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:26,661
used, including attacks on those stream ciphers.
You've seen what the modern stream ciphers

238
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:30,480
look like with this nonce. And you
see the performance numbers for these

239
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,546
modern stream ciphers so if you happen to
need a stream cipher you could use one of

240
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:37,991
the eStream finalists. In particular you
could use something like Salsa.
