1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,518
In this segment, we're gonna look at
attacks on the one time pad, and some

2
00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:06,542
things you need to be careful with when
you use the stream cipher. But before we

3
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:10,012
do that, let's do a quick review of where
we were. So recall that the one time

4
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:14,121
pad encrypts messages by XORing the
message and a secret key, where the secret

5
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:18,653
key is as long as the message. Similarly,
decryption is done by similarly

6
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:22,637
XORing the cipher text, and the same
secret key. When the key is uniform and

7
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:27,123
random, we prove that the one-time pad has
this information theoretic security that

8
00:00:27,123 --> 00:00:31,292
Shannon called perfect secrecy. A problem
was, of course, the keys are as long as

9
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:35,610
the message, so the one-time pad is very
difficult to use. We then talked about a

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,109
way to make the one time pad practical by
using a pseudo random generator that

11
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,438
expands a short seed into a much larger
message and the way a stream cypher

12
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:49,109
worked, essentially using a pseudo random
generator, was in the same way as the one

13
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,666
time pad, basically, but rather than using a
truly random pad, we used this pseudo

14
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:58,337
random pad that's expanded to be as long
as the message from the short key that's

15
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:02,402
given as input to the generator. We said
now the security no longer relies on

16
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:06,090
perfect secrecy because stream ciphers
cannot be perfectly secure. Instead

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,978
security relies on properties of the
pseudo random generator and we said that

18
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:14,014
the pseudo random generator essentially
needs to be unpredictable, but in fact it

19
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:18,251
turns out that definition is a little bit
hard to work with and we're going to see a

20
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:22,288
better definition of security for PRGs in
about two segments. But in this segment

21
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:26,326
we're going to talk about attacks on the
one time pad. And the first attack I want to

22
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:30,623
talk about is what's called the two time pad
attack, okay? so remember that the

23
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:36,149
one time pad is called "one time" pad because
the pad can only be used to encrypt a

24
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,058
single message. I want to show you that if
the same pad is used to encrypt more than

25
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:45,678
one message, then security goes out the
window, and basically an eavesdropper can

26
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:50,240
completely decrypt encrypted messages.
So let's look at an example. So here we

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,513
have two messages m1 and m2 that are
encrypted using the same pad. So the

28
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:58,729
resulting ciphertext, C1 and C2, again
basically are encryptions of these

29
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,238
messages, m1 and m2, but both are
encrypted using the same pad. Now suppose

30
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:09,507
an eavesdropper intercepts C1 and C2, and
he obtains, he basically has both C1 and C2.

31
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:15,168
The natural thing for the eavesdropper
to do is actually compute the XOR of C1

32
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:20,948
and C2 and what does he get when he
computes this XOR? So I hope everybody

33
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:25,178
sees that, basically, once you XOR
C1 and C2, the pads cancel out, and

34
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:29,747
essentially, what comes out of this is the
XOR of the plaintext messages.

35
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:34,372
And it turns out that English basically
has enough redundancy, such that if I give

36
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:38,772
you the XOR of two plaintext
messages, you can actually recover those

37
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:43,115
two mesages completely. More importantly
for us is these messages are encoded

38
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:47,515
using ASCII. In fact, ASCII encodings has
enough redundancy, such that given the

39
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:52,027
XOR of two ASCII encoded messages,
you can recover the original messages

40
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:56,711
back. So, essentially, given these XORs,
you can recover both messages. So the

41
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:01,535
thing to remember here is if you ever use
the same pad to encrypt multiple messages

42
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:06,071
an attack who intercepts the resulting
ciphertexts can eventually recover the

43
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:10,818
existing plaintexts without too much
work. So, the stream cipher key or the

44
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:16,167
one time pad key should never ever, ever,
ever be used more than once. So, let's

45
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:20,904
look at some examples where this comes up
in practice. It's a very common mistake to

46
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:25,360
use the stream cipher key, or a one time
pad key more than once. Now, let me show

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,210
you some examples where this comes up. So
you know to avoid these mistakes, when you

48
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,060
build your own systems. The first example
is a historic example. At the beginning of

49
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,402
the 1940s, where the Russians actually
used a one time pad to encrypt various

50
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:43,970
mesages. Unfortunately, the pads that they
were using were generated by a human by

51
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,394
throwing dice. And so, you know, the human
would throw these dice, and write down the

52
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,884
results of these throws. And the collected
throws would then form the pads that were

53
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:57,053
used for encryption. Now, because it was
kind of laborious for them to generate

54
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:01,330
these pads, it seems wasteful to use the
pads to encrypt just one message. So the

55
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,762
ended up using these pads to encrypt
multiple messages. And US intelligence was

56
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:10,366
actually able to intercept these two time
pads. These ciphertexts that were

57
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:14,865
encrypted using the same pad, applied to
different messages. And it turns out, over

58
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:19,177
a period of several years, they we're able
to decrypt something like 3,000 plain

59
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:23,273
texts just by intercepting these ciphertexts.
The project is called Project Venona

60
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:27,478
It's actually a fascinating
of cryptanalysis, just because the two

61
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,985
time pad is insecure. More importantly, I
want to talk about more recent examples

62
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:36,450
that come up in networking protocols, so
let me give you an example from Windows NT,

63
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,697
in a product called the,
point-to-point transfer protocol. This is

64
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,726
a protocol for a client wishing to
communicate securely with a server. The

65
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:49,355
client and the server both share a secret
key here, and they both send messages to

66
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:53,438
one another. So, here, we'll denote the
messages from the client by m1. So, the

67
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:57,903
client sends a message, the server
responds, the client sends a message, the

68
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:02,710
server responds, the client sends a
message, the server responds, and so on

69
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,723
and so forth. Now, the way PPTP works is,
basically, the entire interaction, from

70
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:12,996
the client to the server, is considered as
one stream. In other words, what happens

71
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:17,944
is, the messages m1, and m2 and m3, are
kind of viewed as one long stream.

72
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:22,501
Here, these two parallel lines means
concatenation. So, essentially, we're

73
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:27,840
concatenating all the messages from the
client to the server into one long stream.

74
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,649
And all that stream is encrypted using the
stream cipher with key K. So that's

75
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:38,463
perfectly fine. I mean, there's nothing
wrong with that. This messages are

76
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,807
encrypted, are treated as one long stream,
and they're all encrypted using the same

77
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:46,727
key. The problem is, the same thing is
happening also on the server side. In

78
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:50,647
other words, all the messages from the
server are also treated as one long

79
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:54,890
stream. So here, they're all concatenated
together. And encrypted using,

80
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:01,010
unfortunately, the same pseudo-random
seed, in other words, using the same

81
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,930
stream cipher key. So basically what's
happening here is you see an effect that

82
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,265
the two time pad is taking place where the
set of messages from the client is

83
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:14,656
encrypted using the same one time pad as a
set of messages from the server. The

84
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:19,158
lesson here is that you should never use
the same key to encrypt traffic in both

85
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:23,548
directions. In fact, what you need to do
is have one key for interaction between

86
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:28,050
the client and the server and one key for
interaction between the server and the

87
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,651
client. The way I like to write this is
really that the shared key k really is a

88
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:38,059
pair of keys. One key is used to encrypt
messages from server to client, and one

89
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:42,920
key is used to encrypt messages from
client to server. So these are two

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,054
separate keys that are used, and both
sides, of course, know this key. So both

91
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:52,663
sides have this pair of keys, okay? and
they can both encrypt. So one is used to

92
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:57,107
encrypt messages in one direction and one
is used to encrypt messages in the other

93
00:06:57,107 --> 00:07:01,230
direction. So another important example of
the two time pad comes up in Wi-Fi

94
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,728
communication, particularity in the 80211B
protocol. So all of you I'm sure know that

95
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:10,225
the 80211 contains an encryption layer and
the original encryption layer was called

96
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:14,723
WEP and WEP fortunately for us is actually
a very badly designed protocol so that I

97
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:18,792
can always use it as an example of how not
to do things. There are many, many

98
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:23,236
mistakes inside of WEP and here I want to
use it as an example of how the two time

99
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:27,362
pad came about. So let me explain how WEP
works. So in WEP, there's a client and,

100
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:31,423
and access point. Here's the client,
here's the access point. They both share a

101
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:35,589
secret key K. And then, when they wanna
transmit a message to one another. Say

102
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,492
these are frames, that they
transmit to one another. Let's say the

103
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:44,274
client wants to send. A frame containing
the plain text M to the axis point, what

104
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:49,319
he would do is first of all he appends
some sort of check sum to this plain text.

105
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,301
The check sum is not important at this
point, what is important is then this new

106
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:59,595
calculation gets encrypted using a stream
cypher where the stream cypher key is this

107
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:06,570
concatenation of a value IV and a long
term key K. So this IV is a 24 bit string.

108
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,742
Okay, this IV is a 24 bit string, and you
can imagine that it starts from zero and

109
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:16,468
perhaps it's a counter that counts
increments by one for every packet. The

110
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:21,769
reason they did this was the designers of
Wep realized that in a stream cypher, the

111
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:27,006
key is only supposed to be used to encrypt
one message. So they said well, let's go

112
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:31,860
ahead and change the key after every
frame. And the way they changed the key

113
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,931
essentially was by prepending this IV to
it. And you notice this I-V changes on

114
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:42,036
every packet. So it increments by one on
every packet. And the idea, then, is sent

115
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:47,335
in the clear along with the cipher text.
So the recipient knows the key K. He knows

116
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:52,440
what the I-V is. He can rederive the PRG
of IV concatenating  K. And then decrypts

117
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,541
the cipher text to recover the original
message M. Now the problem with this

118
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:02,749
of course is the IV is only 24 bits long.
Which means that there are only two to the

119
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:07,646
24 possible IV's. Which means that after
sixteen million frames are transmitted.

120
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:12,291
Essentially the IV has to cycle. And once
it cycles after 60 million frames.

121
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:16,934
Essentially we get a two time path. The
same IV will be used to encrypt two

122
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:21,699
different messages. The TK never changes.
It's a long term key. And as a result,

123
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:26,586
that same key, namely the IV concatenated K
would be used to encrypt two different

124
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:31,349
frames, and the attacker can then figure
out the plain text of both frames. So

125
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:36,297
that's one problem. And the worst problem
is in fact that on many 80211 cards, if

126
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:41,216
you powercycle the card, the IV will reset
back to zero. And as a result, everytime

127
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:45,531
you powercycle the card, essentially
you'll be encrypting the next payload

128
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:49,847
using zero concatenated K  So after every
powercycle, you'll be using the zero

129
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:54,279
concatenated K key to encrypt many, many,
many times the same packets. So you see

130
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,178
how in WEP, the same pad could be used to
encrypt many different messages as soon as

131
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:03,668
the IV is repeated. There is nothing to
prevent the IV from repeating after a

132
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:08,220
powercycle. Or am repeating after every
sixteen million frames which isn't that

133
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,946
many frames in a busy network. So while we
are talking about WEP. I want to mention

134
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,540
one more mistake that was done in WEP.
This is a pretty significant mistake and

135
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,366
let's see how we might design it better.
So you notice that the designers of WEP

136
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:27,017
basically wanted to use a different key
for every packet. Okay. So every frame is

137
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:31,145
encrypted using a different key
is concatonation of IV and K.

138
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:35,325
Unfortunately. They didn't randomize the
keys and the keys are actually, if you

139
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:38,849
look at the key for frame number one,
well, you know, it will be this

140
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:43,004
concatenation of one and k. We'll just
feel this 24 bits. Then the key for frame

141
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:47,369
number two is the concatenation of two and
k. The key for frame number three is the

142
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:51,629
concatenation of three and k. So the keys
are very closely related to one another.

143
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:55,889
And I should probably mention also that
these keys themselves can be 104 bits so

144
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,362
that the resulting PRG key. Is actually
104 plus 24 bytes which is 128 bytes.

145
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:05,097
Unfortunately these keys are very much
related to one another. These are not

146
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:10,268
random keys. You notice they all have the
same suffix of 104 bytes. And it turns out

147
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:15,377
the pseudo-random generator used in Wep is
not designed to be secure when you use

148
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:20,548
related keys that are so closely related.
In other words, the majority of these keys

149
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:25,477
are basically the same. And in fact, for
the PRG that's used in WEP. That PRG is

150
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:30,860
called, RSC four. We'll talk about that
more in the next segment. It turns out

151
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,243
there's an attack. It was discovered by
Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir

152
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:41,763
back in 2001, that shows that after about
ten to the six of, after about a million

153
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:47,105
frames. You can recover the secret key.
Can recover key. So, this is kind of a

154
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:52,497
disastrous attack that says essentially
all you have to do is listen to a million

155
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:57,707
frames. These frames basically. As we said
they're all generated from a very common

156
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:02,813
seed, namely a 104 bits of these seeds are
all the same. The fact that they've used

157
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:07,794
such closely related keys is enough to
actually recover the original key. And it

158
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:12,527
turns out even after the 2001 attack,
better attacks have come out that show

159
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:17,010
that these related keys are very much
disastrous and in fact these days

160
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,298
something like 40,000 frames are
sufficient. And so that, within a matter

161
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:25,334
of minutes, you can actually recover the
secret key in any WEP network. So

162
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:29,535
WEP provides no security at all
for two reasons. First of all, it can

163
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:33,792
resolve in the two time pad. But more
significantly, because these keys are so

164
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:38,271
closely related, it's actually possible to
recover the key by watching just a few

165
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,532
cipher texts. And by the way, we'll see
that well, when we do a security analysis

166
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:46,987
of these steps of constructions. In a few
segments, we'll start talking about how to

167
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:51,174
analyze these steps of constructions.
We'll see that when we have related keys

168
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:55,361
like this, in fact, our security analysis
will fail. We won't be able to get the

169
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:59,870
proof to go through. So one could ask what
should the designers of a WEP should have

170
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,949
done, instead? Well, one approach is to
basically treat the frames, you know M1,

171
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,350
M2, M3. Each, each one is a separate frame
transmitter from the client to the server.

172
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,620
He could have treated them as one
long stream, and then XOR them

173
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,075
potentially. Using the pseudo random
generator as one long stream. So the first

174
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:21,651
segment of the pad would have been used to
encrypt M1. The second

175
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:25,548
segment of the pad would have been used to
encrypt M2. The third segment

176
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:29,400
of the pad would have been used to encrypt
M3. And so on and so forth.

177
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,323
So they basically could never have had to
change the key because the entire

178
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:38,106
interaction is viewed as one long stream.
But they chose to have a different key for

179
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:42,881
every frame. So if you want to do that, a
better way to do that is, rather than

180
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:47,718
slightly modifying this IV that just
slightly modifies the prefix of the key,

181
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:52,742
of the PRG key. A better way to do that is
to use a PRG again. So essentially, what

182
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:57,517
you could do is you will take your long
term key. And then feed that directly

183
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:02,726
through a PRG. So now we get a long stream
of bits that look essentially random.

184
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:07,563
And then the initial segment could be
used, the first segment could be used as

185
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:14,577
the key, or frame number one. And then the
second segment would be used as the key

186
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:20,173
for, you know, key for frame number two.
And so on and so forth. The third segment

187
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:25,138
would be used to encrypt frame #three and
so on and so forth, okay? So the nice

188
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:30,361
thing about this is now, essentially, by
doing this, each frame has a pseudo-random

189
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:35,390
key. These keys, now, have no relation to
one another. They look like random keys.

190
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,613
And as a result, if the PRG is secure for
random Cs, it was also be secure on this

191
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,871
input. Because these keys essentially look
as though they're independent of one

192
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:49,379
another. We'll see how to do this analysis
formally once we talk about these types of

193
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,621
constructions. Since this two-time pad
attack comes up so often in practice, it's

194
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:58,076
such a common mistake, I want to give one
more example where it comes up so you know

195
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:02,000
how to avoid it. The last example I want
to give is in the context of disk

196
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,243
encryption. So imagine we have a certain
file and maybe the file begins with, you

197
00:15:06,243 --> 00:15:10,447
know, the words to Bob. And then the
contents of the file follows when this is

198
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:14,920
stored on disk of course the file is gonna
get so here we have our disk here, the

199
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,404
file is going to get broken into blocks.
And each block will be, you know, when we

200
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:23,726
actually store this on a disk, you know,
things will be encrypted. You know, so

201
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:28,446
maybe to Bob will go into the first block
and then the rest of the content will go

202
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:33,109
into the remaining blocks. But of course
this is all incrypted so I'll kind of use

203
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:37,829
these lines here to denote the fact that
this is encrypted. And an attacker looking

204
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:42,605
at the disk has no idea what the contents
of the message is. But now suppose that at

205
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:46,700
a later time, user goes ahead and
modifies, basically fires up the editor.

206
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,745
It modifies the file, so now instead of
saying to Bob, it says to Eve. And nothing

207
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:56,853
else changes in the file, that's the only
change that was made. When the user then

208
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:01,520
saves this modified file to disk,
basically he's gonna re encrypt it again.

209
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,345
And so the same thing is gonna happen. The
file is gonna get broken into blocks. You

210
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:10,416
know, now the file's gonna say to Eve. And
everything, of course, is gonna be

211
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:15,037
encrypted. So again, I'll, put these lines
here. Now an attacker looking at the disc,

212
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:19,713
taking a snapshot of the disc before the
edits. And then looking again at the disc

213
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:24,334
after the edits. What he will see is that
the only thing that changed is this little

214
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:29,311
segment here. That's now different.
Everything else looks exactly the same. So

215
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:34,134
the attacker, even though he doesn't know
what actually happened to the file within

216
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:38,900
the file or what changed, he knows exactly
the location where the edits took place.

217
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,840
And so the fact that the one-time path or
a stream cypher encrypts one bit at a time

218
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,839
means that if one change takes place, then
it's very easy to tell where that change

219
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,430
occurred instantly. That leaks information
that the attacker shouldn't actually

220
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,080
learn. Ideally you'd like to say that even
if the file changed just a little bit.

221
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,818
Entire contents of the file should change.
Or maybe at least the entire contents of

222
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:07,557
the blocks should change. Here you can see
the attacker even knows within the block

223
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:12,125
where the change was actually made, okay.
So in fact, because of this, it's usually

224
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:16,522
a bad idea to use stream cyphers for disk
encryption. And essentially this is

225
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:21,146
another example of a two-time pad attack
because the same pad is used to encrypt

226
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:26,057
two different messages. This, they happen
to be very similar, but nevertheless these

227
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:30,582
are two different messages, and the
attacker can learn what the change was and

228
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:35,339
in fact he might be able to even learn
what the actual changed words were, as a

229
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,192
result of this. Okay, so the lesson here
is generally we need to do something

230
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:43,249
different for disk encryption. We'll talk
about what to do for disk encryption in a

231
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:46,965
later segment, but essentially the
one-time pad is generally not a good idea

232
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,631
for encrypting blocks on disks. So just
again to summarize the two-time pad

233
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:54,493
attack, we saw that you're supposed, I
hope I've convinced you that you're never

234
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:58,551
ever, ever supposed to use a stream cypher
key more than once. Even though there are

235
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:02,560
natural settings where that might happen,
you have to take care and make sure that

236
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,440
you're not using the same key more than
once. So for network traffic typically

237
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,566
what you're supposed to do is every
session would have its own key. Within the

238
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:14,742
session the message from the client and
the server look as one complete stream. It

239
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:18,765
would be encrypted using one key. Is, the
messages from the server to the client

240
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,636
would be treated as one stream and
encrypted using a different key. And then

241
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:26,761
for this encryption typically would not
use a stream cypher because. As changes

242
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:31,509
are made to the file, he would be leaking
information about the contents of the

243
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:36,136
file. Okay, so that concludes our brief
discussion of the two time pad.

244
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:41,092
Next attack I want to mention. Is a fact
that the one time path and stream cyphers

245
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:45,578
in general provide no integrity at all.
All they do is they try to provide

246
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:50,610
confidentiality when the key's only used
once. They provide no integrity at all but

247
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,581
even worse than that it's actually very
easy to modify cypher text and have known

248
00:18:55,581 --> 00:19:00,310
effects on the corresponding plain text.
So let me explain what I mean by that.

249
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:05,025
This property, by the way, is called
malleability, and we'll see what I mean by

250
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:09,682
that in just a second. So imagine we have
some message M that gets encrypted. So,

251
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:14,279
here, it gets encrypted using a stream
cipher. And the cipher text, of course, is

252
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,690
then gonna be, M XOR a K. Now an
attacker intercepts the cypher text. Well,

253
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,175
that doesn't tell him what's, what the
plain text is but what he can do is now

254
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:27,660
beyond eavesdropping he can actually
become an active attacker and modify the

255
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,742
cypher text. So when I say modify the
cypher text let's suppose that he

256
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:36,955
XOR the cypher text with a certain
value P. Whats called a sub-permutation key.

257
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,020
Well, the resulting cipher text then
becomes M XOR K, XOR P. So now I'll

258
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:48,207
ask you, when we decrypt the cipher text,
what is it going to decrypt to? Well I

259
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:53,613
hope everybody sees manipulating the XORs
Basically the decryption becomes M XOR P

260
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:58,952
So you notice that by XOR with this pad P, the attacker was able to

261
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:03,700
have a very specific effect on the
resulting plain text. Okay. So a summary

262
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,135
is basically you can modify the cypher
text. These modifications are undetected.

263
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:12,289
But even worse, they're undetected, they
have a very specific impact on the

264
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:16,893
resulting plain text. Namely whatever you
XOR the cipher text with is going to have

265
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:21,384
that exact effect on the plain text. So to
see where this can be dangerous, let's

266
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:25,987
look at a particular example. Suppose the
user sends an email that starts with the

267
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:30,661
words from Bob. In the attacker
intercepts the corresponding cypher text.

268
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:35,236
He doesn't know what the cypher text is
but let's just for the sake of it let's

269
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:39,851
pretend that he actually knows that this
message is actually from Bob. What he

270
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:44,240
wants to do is he wants to modify the
ciphertext so that the plain text would

271
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,686
now look like it came from somebody else.
Say, he wants to make it look like this

272
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:53,131
message actually came from Alice. All he
has is the ciphertext. Well, what he can

273
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:57,521
do is he can XOR with a certain
three characters. We'll see

274
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:01,799
what those three characters are in just a
second. And such that the resulting

275
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,411
ciphertext is actually an encryption of
the message from Eve. And so that now when

276
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:10,490
the user decrypts that. All of a sudden
he'll see, Hey, this message is from Eve.

277
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,564
It's not, he'll think this message is from
Eve, not from Bob. And that might cause

278
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,677
you know, the wrong thing to take place.
So here the attacker, even though he

279
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:23,405
himself could not have created a cypher
text that says from Eve, by modifying an

280
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:28,192
existing cypher text all of a sudden he
was able to make the cypher text that he

281
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,802
could not have done without intercepting
at least one cypher text. So again by

282
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:37,529
intercepting one cypher text he was able
to change it so not it looks like it's

283
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:42,316
from Eve, rather than from Bob. So just to
be specific, let's look what these three

284
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:47,756
characters need to be, so let's look at
the word Bob. And I'm going to write it in

285
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:54,285
askee. So Bob in askee corresponds to 42
hex six f hex and 62 hex. So little b is

286
00:21:54,285 --> 00:22:00,815
encoded as 62, little o is encoded as six
f. The word eve is encoded as 45 hex, 76

287
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:07,262
hex, and 65 hex. Now when I XOR these
two words, I'm literally going to x over

288
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:13,791
them as bit strings. So Bob XOR eve,
it's not difficult to see that what I get

289
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:19,798
are the three characters zero, seven.
Nineteen and 07. So really what these

290
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:25,536
three characters here are going to be. Are
simply 07, nineteen, and 07. And by

291
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,340
XORing these three characters at the
right positions into the cipher text, the

292
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,003
attacker was able to chance the cipher
text to look like it came from Eve rather

293
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:41,892
than from Bob. So this is an example
where having a predictable impact on the

294
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:46,410
cipher text can actually cause quite a bit
of problems. And this is this property

295
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,817
called malleability. And we say that the
one time pad is malleable because it's

296
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:54,833
very easy to compute in cipher texts, and
make prescribed changes to the

297
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:59,184
corresponding plain text. So to prevent
all this, I'm gonna do that, actually, in

298
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:03,479
two or three lectures. And we're gonna
basically show how to add integrity to

299
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:07,689
encryption mechanisms in general. But
right now I want you to remember that the

300
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:11,551
one time pad by itself has no integrity
and is completely insecure against

301
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,024
attackers that actually modify the cipher
texts.
