1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:03,576
Now that we understand how DES works, let's look at a few attacks on DES,

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:06,594
and we're going to start with an attack called exhaustive search.

3
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:12,817
So our goal here is basically that given a few input-output pairs, (mi, ci),

4
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:16,867
our goal is to find the key that maps these m's to the c's.

5
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:24,667
In other words, our goal is to find the key that maps m1, m2, m3 into c1, c2, c3,

6
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:27,867
and as I said, our goal is to find the key that does this mapping.

7
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:30,800
The first question is, how do we know that this key is unique?

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,467
And so, let's do a little bit of analysis to show that in fact

9
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,267
just one pair is enough to completely constrain a DES key,

10
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:40,800
and that's why this question makes sense.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,352
OK, so let's see. So we're going to prove this simple lemma.

12
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:47,267
Now let's assume that DES is what's called an ideal cipher.

13
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:52,245
So what is an ideal cipher? Basically we're going to pretend like DES is made up of

14
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:58,867
random invertible functions. In other words, for every key, DES implements a random invertible function.

15
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:04,528
Since there are 2^56 keys in DES, we're going to pretend like DES really is a collection

16
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:15,233
of 2^56 functions that are invertible from {0,1}^64 to {0,1}^64. OK? So of course,

17
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:21,800
DES is not a collection of 2^56 random functions, but we can idealize about the cipher and pretend

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,380
that it is such a collection. Then what can we say?

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,115
Then in fact it turns out that just given one message and ciphertext, you just give me

20
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:38,867
one pair, message and ciphertext, there's already only one key that maps this message to that ciphertext.

21
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:46,467
So already just given one pair m and c, I can ask you, find me the key that maps m to c,

22
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:53,000
and the solution is very likely to be unique. In fact it's going to be unique with probability roughly 99.5%.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,467
I should say that this statement is true for all m and c, and the probability is just over the choice

24
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:02,467
of the random permutations that make up the cipher.

25
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:05,666
So let's write a proof. This is fairly straightforward. So what we're basically asking is,

26
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:11,467
what's the probability that there exists some key that's not equal to k such that,

27
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:19,111
well, c we know is equal to DES(k, m) by defintion of c and m, but we're asking how likely is it

28
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:24,103
that there's this other key, k-prime, that also satisfies this equality?

29
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:29,699
You realize that if this is true, if such a key k-prime exists, then just given m and c,

30
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:35,040
you can't decide whether the right key is k or k-prime, because both of them work. OK?

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,000
But I want to argue that this happens with low probability.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,467
Well, so what does it mean that there exists a key k-prime that satisfies this relation?

33
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:48,133
Well, we're asking, what's the probability that the first key, the all-zero key, satisfies it?

34
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:52,037
Or, the second key satisfies it. Or, the third key satisfies it. And so on and so forth.

35
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:58,979
So by the union bound, we can bound this probability by the sum over all keys k-prime,

36
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:10,102
over all 56-bit keys, of the probability that DES(k,m) is equal to DES(k-prime, m).

37
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:15,600
OK? So we're asking, basically, what is this probability, for a fixed key k-prime,

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,178
that it happens to collide with the key k at the message m? Well, let's think about this for a second.

39
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:25,400
Let's fix this value, let's suppose it's some fixed value. And then we're asking,

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,348
how likely is it that a random permutation, pi k-prime, at the point m,

41
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:37,014
happens to produce exactly the same output as the key k at the point m?

42
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, it's not difficult to answer and see that in fact this is, for a single key k-prime,

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,040
the probability is at most one over 2^64. Right? There are 2^64 possible outputs for the permutation,

44
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,822
what's the probability that it lands exactly on this output, well, it's one over 2^64.

45
00:03:55,822 --> 00:04:00,652
And we're summing over all 2^56 keys, so we just multiply the two,

46
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:06,758
we get one over 2^8, which is basically one over 256. OK? So the probability

47
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:12,099
that the key is not unique is one over 256, therefore the probability that it is unique

48
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:18,800
is one minus that, which is 99.5%. OK? So already, if you give me one plaintext-ciphertext pair,

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,430
the key is completely determined. There's only one key that will map that plaintext

50
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,774
to that ciphertext, and the question is just, can you find that key?

51
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:32,933
Now it turns out in fact if you give me two pairs, so you give me m1 and m2,

52
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:37,780
and their corresponding outputs, c1 and c2, the probability basically

53
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,821
—just do exactly the same analysis, the probability basically becomes one.

54
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:46,766
That there's only one such key. OK, essentially, this is very, very, very close to 1,

55
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:51,248
and basically it says given two pairs, it's very very likely that only one key

56
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:56,031
will map this pair of messages to this pair of ciphertexts, and as a result again,

57
00:04:56,031 --> 00:05:00,559
we can ask, well, find me that unique key. And by the way, the same is true for AES,

58
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:05,226
if you look at AES-128, again, just given two input-output pairs,

59
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:09,638
there's going to be only one key with very high probability. So essentially now

60
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:14,654
we can ask this exhaustive search problem, I give you two or three pairs, and I ask you,

61
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:19,228
well, find me the key. So how are you going to do it? Well, you're going to do it by exhaustive search,

62
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:24,824
essentially by trying all possible keys, one by one, until you find the right one.

63
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:29,816
So this is what's known as the DES challenge. So let me explain how the DES challenge worked.

64
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:34,333
The challenge was issued by a company called RSA, and what they did is basically,

65
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:40,333
they published a number of ciphertexts, but three of the ciphertexts had known plaintexts.

66
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:46,133
So in particular, what they did is they took the message here: The unknown message is, colon,

67
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:50,867
and you can see they broke it up into blocks. If you look at these, these are basically

68
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:57,267
eight-byte blocks. Eight bytes, as you know, is 64 bits, right, so each of these is 64 bits.

69
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:01,651
And then they encrypted them using a secret key. They encrypted them all using the same

70
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:07,711
secret key to get three ciphertexts. So this gives us three plaintext-ciphertext pairs,

71
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:12,239
and then they gave us a whole bunch of other ciphertexts, you know, c4, c5, c6,

72
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:16,372
and the challenge was, decrypt these guys using the key that you found

73
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:20,784
from an exhaustive search over the first three pairs that you were given.

74
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:25,683
OK. So that was called the DES challenge, and let me tell you a little bit

75
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:31,467
about how long it took to solve it. So interestingly, in 1997, using an Internet search,

76
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:36,574
using distributed.net, basically, they were able to search through enough of the keyspace

77
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:42,779
to find the correct key in about three months. You realize the keyspace has size 2^56,

78
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:47,487
but on average you only have to search through half the keyspace to find the key,

79
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:51,574
and so it took them three months. Then, kind of a miraculous thing happened.

80
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:57,890
The EFF actually contracted Paul Kocher to build special-purpose hardware to break DES.

81
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:03,416
This was a machine called Deep Crack. It cost about 250,000 dollars, and it broke

82
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:09,500
the next DES challenge in only three days. Interestingly, by the way, RSA said that

83
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,120
they would pay ten thousand dollars for each solution of a challenge, so you can see

84
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,439
that this is not quite economical. They spent 250K, they got ten thousand dollars

85
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,154
for solving the challenge. The next thing that happened is in 1999,

86
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:27,286
RSA issued another challenge, and they said, well, I'm gonna solve it in half the time

87
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:32,600
of the previous solution, and so using both Deep Crack and the Internet search together,

88
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,622
they were able to break DES in 22 hours.

89
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:40,498
So the bottom line here is, essentially, DES is completely dead.

90
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:45,351
Essentially, if you forget, or you lose your DES 56-bit key, don't worry—

91
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:51,226
within 22 hours, you can actually recover it and in fact, anyone can recover it, and so

92
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:56,467
DES essentially is dead and no longer secure. And just kind of a final nail in the coffin,

93
00:07:56,467 --> 00:08:03,765
as hardware technology improved, there was another project called COPACABANA that used FPGAs,

94
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:11,450
just off-the-shelf FPGAs, only 120 FPGAs. It only cost 10,000 dollars. And they were able to break,

95
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,768
to do an exhaustive key search in about seven days. So very, very cheap hardware, just off the shelf,

96
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:21,365
you can break DES already very quickly. So the lesson from all this is essentially,

97
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:26,467
56-bit ciphers are totally, totally dead. And so the question is what to do.

98
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:30,700
People really liked DES, it was deployed in a lot of places, there were a lot of implementations,

99
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,415
there was a lot of hardware support for it, so the question was what to do.

100
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:37,933
And so the first thing that came to mind is, well maybe we can take DES

101
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:42,681
and we can kind of artificially expand the key size, so we strengthen it against

102
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:47,400
this exhaustive search attack. And the first idea that comes to mind is basically,

103
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,900
well, let's iterate the block cipher a couple of times. And this is what's called Triple DES.

104
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,200
So Triple DES is a general construction. Basically it says the following.

105
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,957
Suppose you gave me a block cipher E. So here, it has a keyspace K,

106
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,974
it has a message space M, and an output space of course M as well.

107
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:10,429
Let's define the triple construction, which now uses three keys, and it's defined as follows,

108
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:15,561
basically, here, the triple construction uses three independent keys, encrypts the same

109
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:21,412
message block as before, and what it does is, it will encrpyt using the key k3,

110
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:29,098
then it will decrypt using the key k2, then it will encrypt again using the key k1.

111
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:33,881
OK so basically encrpyting three times, using three independent keys.

112
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:40,104
You might be wondering, why is it doing E, D, E, why not just do E, E, E?

113
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:43,843
Why do we have to have a D in the middle? Well, that's just for, uh, kind of a hack.

114
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:50,019
You notice what happens if you set up k1 equals k2 equals k3? What happens if all three keys

115
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:57,200
are the same? Well, basically, what will happen is, one E and one D would cancel,

116
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,419
and you would just get normal DES out. So it's just a hack so that if you have a hardware implementation

117
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:07,504
of Triple DES, you can set all three keys to be the same, and you'll get a hardware implementation

118
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:12,101
of single DES. Of course it'll be three times as slow as a regular impelmentation of single DES,

119
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:17,094
but nevertheless, it's still an option. OK, so for Triple DES now we get a key size

120
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:25,499
that's 3 times 56, which is 168 bits; this is, 168 bits is way too long to do an exhaustive search on.

121
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:31,420
That will take time 2^168, which is more than all the machines on earth working for ten years

122
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,800
would be able to do. Unfortunately, of course, the cipher is three times slower than DES.

123
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,964
So this is a real problem with Triple DES. Now I want to mention that in fact you might think

124
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:49,160
Triple DES has security 2^168, but in fact, there is a simple attack that runs in time 2^118,

125
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,800
and I want to show you how that attack works. OK? So— but in fact 2^118 is still a large number.

126
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,814
In fact, anything that's, kind of, bigger than 2^90 is considered sufficiently secure.

127
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:06,668
2^118 is definitely sufficiently secure against exhaustive search,

128
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:09,933
and generally is considered a high enough level of security.

129
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:14,447
So clearly Triple DES is three times as slow as DES. So the question is,

130
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:18,467
why did they repeat the cipher three times? Why not repeat the cipher just two times,

131
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:21,297
or in particular, the question is, what's wrong with double DES?

132
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:25,546
So here we have double DES. Basically you see it uses only two keys, and it uses only

133
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:30,979
two applications of the block cipher, and as a result it's only going to be twice as slow as DES,

134
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:36,067
not three times as slow as DES. Well, the key length for double DES is 2 times 56, which is

135
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:42,613
112 bits, and in fact doing exhaustive search on a space of 112 bits is too much.

136
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:47,400
2^112 is too big of a number to do exhaustive search over such a large space.

137
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,227
So the question is, what's wrong with this construction. Well, it turns out

138
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:54,687
this construction is completely insecure, and I want to show you an attack.

139
00:11:54,687 --> 00:12:01,200
So, suppose I'm given a bunch of inputs, say m1 to m10, and I'm given the corresponding outputs

140
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:09,060
c1 to c10. What's my goal? Well, my goal is basically to find keys, you know, a pair of keys k1, k2,

141
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:17,559
such that if I encrypt the message M using these keys, in other words if I do this encryption,

142
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:23,248
this double DES encryption, then I get the ciphertext vector that was given to me.

143
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:28,067
OK, so our goal is to solve this equation here. Now you stare at this equation a little bit,

144
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:32,267
and you realize, hey wait a minute, I can rewrite it in kind of an interesting way;

145
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:36,483
I can apply the decryption algorithm, and then what I'll get is that I'm really looking for

146
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:43,960
keys k1, k2 that satisfy this equation here, where basically all I did is I applied

147
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:51,400
the decryption algorithm using k1 to both sides. OK, now whenever you see an equation like this,

148
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,918
what just happened here is that we separated our variables into two sides,

149
00:12:55,918 --> 00:13:00,098
the variables now appear on independent sides of the equation, and that usually means

150
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:04,579
that there is a faster attack than exhaustive search, and in fact this attack is called

151
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:09,107
a meet-in-the-middle attack, where really the meet-in-the-middle is going to somehow

152
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:14,169
attack this particular point in the construction. OK, so we're going to try and find a key

153
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,533
that maps m to a particular value here, and maps c to the same value.

154
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:22,969
OK, so let me show you how the attack works. So the first thing we're going to do is

155
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,220
we're going to build a table. Here, let me clear up some space here.

156
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,096
The first step is to build a table that for all possible values of k2,

157
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:35,647
encrypts m under that value. OK, so here we have this table, so you notice

158
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:45,600
these are all 2^56 Single DES keys, OK, so the table has 2^56 entries,

159
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,800
and what we do is basically, for each entry, we compute the encryption of m

160
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,641
under the appropriate key. So this is the encryption of m under the all-zero key,

161
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:59,494
the encryption of m under the one key, and at the bottom, we have the encryption of m

162
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:04,933
under the all-one key. OK, so there are 2^56 entries, and we sort this table based on the second column.

163
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:10,083
OK, so far, so good. So by the way this takes time—to build this table takes time 2^56,

164
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:17,733
and I guess we also want to sort, sorting takes n log n time, so it's 2^56 times log 2^56. OK.

165
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:21,733
So now that we have this table, we've essentially built all possible values

166
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:24,618
in the forward direction for this point.

167
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:28,533
Now what we're going to do is this meet-in-the-middle attack,

168
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:33,094
where now we try to go in the reverse direction with all possible keys k.

169
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:37,761
Essentially we compute the decryption of c under all possible keys k1.

170
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:43,333
OK, so now for each potential decryption, remember the table holds all possible values

171
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:49,580
in the midpoint, so then for each possible decrpytion, we check, hey, is the decryption in the table,

172
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,248
in the second column in the table? If it is in the table, then aha, we found the match,

173
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:58,055
and then what do we know? We know that essentially, well, we found the match, so we know that

174
00:14:58,055 --> 00:15:04,557
say for example a decryption using a particular key k1 happened to match this entry in the table,

175
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:11,151
say, k2 or more generally ki, then we know that the encryption of m under ki

176
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:17,513
is equal to the decryption of c under k. OK, so we kind of build this meet-in-the-middle,

177
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:25,896
where the two sides, you know, the encryption of m under ki and the decryption of c under k,

178
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:32,490
collided, but if they collided, then we know that in fact this pair, ki and k, is equal to

179
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,089
the pair that we're looking for. And so we've just solved our challenge.

180
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,965
So now let's look at what's the running time of this? Well, we had to build a table,

181
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:47,867
and sort it, and then for all possible decryptions, we had to do a search through the table.

182
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:53,690
So there were 2^56 possible decryptions, each search in a sorted table takes log(2^56) time,

183
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:59,400
if you just work it out this turns out to be 2^63, which is way, way, way, way, way smaller

184
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:07,413
than 2^112. OK, so this is a serious attack, it's probably doable today, that runs in a total time

185
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:12,359
of 2^63, which is about the same time as the exhaustive search attack on DES.

186
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:16,446
So really, double DES really didn't solve the exhaustive search problem,

187
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:19,650
because, well, there's an attack on it that runs in about the same time

188
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,086
as exhaustive search on single DES. Now someone might complain

189
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:26,895
that in fact this algorithm, well, we have to store this big table,

190
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:31,283
so it takes up a lot of space, but you know, so be it. Nevertheless, the running time

191
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:35,439
is still quite small or significantly smaller than 2^112.

192
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:39,248
Now you notice, by the way, this same attack applies to Triple DES.

193
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,267
What you would do is you would implement the meet-in-the-middle attack against this point,

194
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:47,867
you would build a table of size 2^56 of all possible encryptions of m,

195
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:53,000
and then you would try to decrypt with all 2^112 keys until you find a collision,

196
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,639
and when you find a collision, you have basically found k1, k2, k3.

197
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,333
OK, so even Triple DES has an attack that basically explores only 2^112 possible keys.

198
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:08,087
But 2^112 is a large enough number, so Triple DES in fact, as far as we know,

199
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:13,706
is sufficiently secure. I should mention that Triple DES is actually a NIST standard,

200
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:19,859
and so Triple DES is actually used quite a bit, and in fact DES should never ever ever be used,

201
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,867
if for some reason you're forced to use some version of DES, use Triple DES, not DES.

202
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:29,310
OK, I want to mention one more method for strengthening DES against exhaustive search attacks.

203
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,118
This method actually is not standardized by NIST, because it doesn't defend against

204
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:37,692
more subtle attacks on DES, but nevertheless if all you're worried about is exhaustive search,

205
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:43,010
and you don't want to pay the performance penalties of Triple DES, then this is an interesting idea.

206
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,630
So let me show you how it works. So let E be a block cipher that operates on n-bit blocks.

207
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:53,319
We're going to define the EX construction, and for DES we're going to get DESX, to be the following.

208
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:59,733
So we use three keys, k1, k2, k3, and then basically before encrpytion, we XOR with k3,

209
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:05,231
then we encrypt using k2, and then after encryption we XOR with k1. That's it.

210
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:09,387
That's the whole construction. So basically, you'll notice it doesn't slow the block cipher much,

211
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:14,403
because all we did is we applied the cipher plus two additional XORs, which are super fast.

212
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:20,092
The key length for this is in fact, well, we got two keys that are as long as the block size,

213
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:25,038
and we got one key that's as long as the key size, so the total is 184 bits.

214
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:31,446
Now, it turns out actually the best attack that's known is actually an attack that takes time 2^120,

215
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:37,158
and this is actually fairly simple. So it's a generic attack on EX, it will always take time basically

216
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:41,222
block size plus the key size, and it's a simple homework problem

217
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:43,892
for you to try to figure out this attack. I think this is a good exercise.

218
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:48,867
OK, in fact there is some analysis to show that there is no exhaustive search attack

219
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:53,041
on this type of construction, so it's a fine construction against exhaustive search,

220
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,600
but there are more subtle attacks on DES that we'll talk about in the next segment,

221
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,566
that basically this construction will not prevent.

222
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:05,789
One thing that I want to point out, unfortunately I found this mistake in a number of products,

223
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:12,383
is if you just decide to XOR on the outside, or if you just decide to XOR on the inside,

224
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:13,985
as opposed to XOR-ing on both sides, which is what DESX does,

225
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:18,165
you notice DESX XORs both on the outside and on the inside,

226
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:22,067
If you just do one of them, then basically this construction does nothing

227
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:26,780
to secure your cipher. It'll still be as vulnerable to exhaustive search

228
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,518
as the original block cipher E. OK, so this is another homework problem,

229
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:34,094
and actually you'll see that as part of our homeworks. OK.

230
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:37,809
So this basically concludes our discussion of exhaustive search attacks,

231
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,292
and next we'll talk about more sophisticated attacks on DES.
