1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,765
Now that we know that block cyphers are we
know how to construct them, let's see how

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:07,898
to use them for secure encryption? But
before that, I wanna briefly remind you of

3
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:11,413
an important abstraction called a
pseudo-random function, and a

4
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:15,949
pseudo-random permutation. So as we said
in the last module, a block cipher's map,

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,428
N bits of inputs to N bits of outputs. And
we saw two examples of block ciphers,

6
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:24,737
triple DES and AES. Now, an important
abstraction of the concept of a block

7
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:28,762
cipher, is captured by this idea of a PRP
and a PRF. And remember that a

8
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:33,185
pseudo-random function, a PRF, basically
is a function that takes two inputs. It

9
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:37,470
takes a key and an element in some set X.
And in outputs an element in some set Y

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,390
and for now the only requirement is that
there's an efficient algorithm to evaluate

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,118
this function. We're going to talk about
security for PRFs in just a minute. And

12
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:49,811
then similarly, there's a related concept
called a pseudo-random permutation, which

13
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:54,561
is similar to a PRF. In fact, there's also
an efficient algorithm to evaluate, the

14
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:58,739
pseudo-random permutation. However,
there's an additional requirement, that

15
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,918
there's also an algorithm D that will
invert this function E. So a PRP, is

16
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:07,562
basically a PRF, but where the function is
required to be one to one for all keys.

17
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:12,204
And there is an efficient inversion
algorithm. So now lets talk about how to

18
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:17,550
define secure PRF's. So we already said
that essentially the goal of a PRF is to

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,229
look like a random function from the set X
to Y. So to capture that more precisely we

20
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:28,508
define this notation, funs XY to be the
set of all functions from the set X, to

21
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:34,054
the set Y. Similarly, we defined the set S
sub F to be the set of all functions from

22
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:39,458
the set X to Y that are defined by the
PRF. In other words. Once you fix the key

23
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:44,991
K, you obtain a function from the set X to
the set Y. And the set of all such

24
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:50,597
functions, given a particular PRF, would
be the set S sub F. So as we said last

25
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:56,713
time, funs XY is generally a gigantic set
of all functions from S to Y. I think I

26
00:01:56,713 --> 00:02:02,537
mentioned that, in fact, for AES, where X
and Y are two to the 128, the size of the

27
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:08,215
set is two to the 128 times two to the
128. It's a double exponential, which is

28
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:12,788
an absolutely enormous number. On the
other hand, the number of functions

29
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:17,110
defined by the AES block cipher is just
two to the hundred and twenty-eight.

30
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,717
Namely, one function from each key. And
what we would like to say is that a random

31
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:25,584
choice from this huge set is
indistinguishable from a random choice

32
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:29,906
from the small set. And what do we mean by
indistinguishable, we mean that an

33
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:34,513
adversary who can interact with a random
function in here, can't distinguish that

34
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:38,949
interaction from an interaction with a
random function in here. Now let's find

35
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:43,268
out more precisely. So we're gonna, as
usual, define two experiments. Experiment

36
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:47,289
zero and experiment one. And our goal is
to say that the adversary can't

37
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:51,254
distinguish these two experiments. So in
experiment zero, the challenger,

38
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,219
basically, is gonna choose a random,
pseudo-random function. Okay? So he's

39
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:59,798
gonna fix the key K at random, and that's
gonna define this function, little f over

40
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:03,765
here, to be one of the functions
implemented by the PRF. And experiment

41
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:08,662
one, on the other hand, the challenger is
gonna choose a truly random function from

42
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:13,261
the set X to the set Y. And again, we're
gonna call this truly random function

43
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:17,979
little f, either way, either experiment
zero or experiment one, the challenger

44
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:23,142
ends up with this little function f that's
either chosen from the PRF, or chosen as a

45
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:28,447
truly random function from X to Y. Now the
adversary basically gets to query this

46
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:33,882
function, little f. So he gets to submit a
query X1 and he obtains the value of f at

47
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:39,056
the point X1, then he gets to submit at
X2, and he obtains the value of f at the

48
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:44,351
point X2. So on and so fourth, he makes Q
queries. And so he learns the value of the

49
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:49,477
function little f at those Q points. Now
his goal is to say whether the function

50
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:54,603
little f is chosen truly at random from
funs XY, or chosen just from the set of

51
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:59,603
functions implemented by the PRF. So he
outputs a certain bit b prime and we'll

52
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:04,602
refer to that output as the output of
experiments, either as experiment zero or

53
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:09,365
experiment one. As usual we say that the
PRF is secure. If, in fact, the adversary

54
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:13,616
can't distinguish these two experiments.
In other words, the probability that he

55
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:17,974
outputs one, experiments zero is the same,
pretty much the same as the probability

56
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:22,333
that he outputs one in experiment one. In
other words, the difference of these two

57
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:26,417
probabilities is negligible. So this
captures nicely, the fact that the

58
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:31,080
adversary couldn't distinguish a
pseudo-random function from a truly random

59
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,682
function from the set X to Y. Now, the
definition for a secure pseudo-random

60
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:40,345
permutation, a secure PRP, which is
basically a secure block cipher, is pretty

61
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:45,254
much the same. In experiment zero, the
adversary's gonna change a random instance

62
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:50,285
of the PRP. So he's gonna choose a random
K, and define little f to be the function

63
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:55,194
that corresponds to little k within the
pseudo-random permutation. In experiment

64
00:04:55,194 --> 00:05:00,311
one: the adversary is gonna choose not a
truly random function from X to Y, but a

65
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:05,694
truly random one to one function from X to
X. Okay? So the goal of our PRP is to look

66
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:10,758
like a random permutation from X to X.
Namely, a random one to one function from

67
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:15,247
the set X to itself. So the little
functional little f here is again gonna be

68
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:19,448
a random function. From the set X to
itself. And again, the challenger ends up

69
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:23,791
with this function, little f. As before,
the adversary gets to submit queries and

70
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:28,124
it gets to see the results of those
queries. And then he shouldn't be able to

71
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:32,707
distinguish, again, experiment zero from
experiment one. So again, given the value

72
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:37,464
of the function f at cue points chosen by
the adversary, he can't tell whether the

73
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:41,873
function f came from a PRP, or
whether it's a truly random permutation

74
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:46,476
from X to X. So let's look at a simple
example. Suppose the set X contains only

75
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:50,974
two points, zero and one. In this case,
Perms[X] is really easy to define.

76
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:55,473
Essentially, there are two points, and
we're looking at, you know, 01. And we're

77
00:05:55,473 --> 00:06:00,208
asking, what is the set of all invertible
functions on the set 01. Well, there are

78
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,706
only two such functions. One function is
the identity function. And the other

79
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:09,264
function is basically the function that
does crossovers, namely this function

80
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:14,028
here. These are the only two invertible
functions in the set 01. So really, Perms[X]

81
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:18,557
only contains two functions, in this
case. Now, let's look at the following

82
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:23,448
PRP. The key space is gonna be 01, and of
course, X is gonna be 01. And let's define

83
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:28,348
the PRP as basically X XOR K. Okay so
that's our PRP and my question to you is,

84
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:33,488
is this a secure PRP. In other words, is
this PRP indistinguishable from a random

85
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:39,211
function on Perms[X]? I hope everybody
said, yes, because essentially, the sets

86
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:45,521
of functions implemented in this PRP, is
identical to the set of functions in Perms[X].

87
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:50,550
So a random choice of key here is
identical to a random choice of function

88
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,675
over here. And as a result, the two
distributions, either pseudo-random or

89
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:58,743
random, are identical. So clearly, an
adversary can't distinguish the two

90
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:03,212
distributions. Now, we already said that
we have a couple of examples of secure

91
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:07,853
PRPs triple DES and AES. And I just wanted
to mention that, if you want to make

92
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:12,322
things very concrete, here's a concrete
security assumptions about AES. Just to

93
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:17,077
give an example, say that all algorithms
had run in time 2^80 have advantage

94
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:22,295
against AES of utmost 2^-40. This
is, a reasonable assumption about AES, and

95
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:26,674
I just wanted to state it for
concreteness. So let's look at another

96
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:31,376
example. Consider again the PRP from the
previous question. Namely XX or K.

97
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:36,270
Remember the set X was just one bit,
namely the value zero and one. And this

98
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,726
time, we're asking, is this PRP a secure
PRF? In other words, is this PRP

99
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:45,411
indistinguishable from a random function
from X to X? Now, the set of random

100
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:50,282
functions from X to X, Funs[XX] in
this case, contains only four elements.

101
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:54,967
There are the two invertible functions,
which we already saw in... I believe the

102
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:59,589
identity function, and the negation
function, the function that

103
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,524
sends zero to one, and one to zero. But
there are two other functions. Namely, the

104
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:10,183
function that sends everything to zero.
And the function that sends everything to

105
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:16,498
one. Okay, these are four functions inside
Funs[XX], and the question is: Is this

106
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:22,507
PRP that we just looked at, is it also
indistinguishable from a random choice

107
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:27,542
from Funs[XX]? So I hope everybody said no
and the reason it's not a secure prf is

108
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:31,949
because there's a simple attack, namely
the attacker supposed to distinguish

109
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,762
whether he's interacting with this PRP or
is he interacting with a random function

110
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:41,343
from Funs[XX]. And the distinguisher
is very simple. Basically we're gonna

111
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:45,923
query the function at both x equals zero
and x equals one, and then if we get a

112
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:50,736
collision, in other words, if f of zero is
equal to f of one, then for sure we're not

113
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:54,907
interacting with a PRP. In which case we
can just output one. In other words we're

114
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:58,967
interacting with a random function. In
other words we say zero. So let's look at

115
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:03,723
the advantage of this distinguisher. Well
when it's interacting with a PRP, it'll

116
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:08,087
never output a one, because f of zero can
never be equal to f of one. In other

117
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:12,621
words, the probability of outputting one
is zero. However, when we interact with a

118
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:17,324
truly random function in Funs[XX],
the probability that f of zero is equal to

119
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:21,915
f of one is exactly one-half.  Cause half the
functions satisfy F of zero's equal to F

120
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:26,335
of one, and half the functions don't. So
then, we'll output one with probability

121
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:30,472
one-half. So the advantage of this
distinguisher is one-half, which is non-negligible.

122
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:35,274
And as a result, this PRP here
is not a secure PRF. Now it turns out this

123
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:40,226
only true because if set X is very small.
And in fact there is an important lemma,

124
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:44,810
called the PRF Switching Lemma, that
says that a secure PRP, is in fact a

125
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,212
secure PRF, whenever the set X is
sufficiently large. And by sufficiently

126
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:53,919
large, I mean say the output space of AES
which is two to the 128th. So by this

127
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,870
lemma which will state more precisely in a
second, AES if it's a secure PRP, it is

128
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,883
also a secure PRF. So this lemma basically
says the following, if you give me a PRP

129
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:10,313
over the set X Then for any adversary that
queries the PRP, at at most Q points, so it

130
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:15,857
makes at most Q queries into the
challenge function. Then, the difference

131
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:20,911
between its advantage in attacking the PRP
when compared to a random function, is

132
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:25,154
very close to its advantage in
distinguishing the PRP from a random

133
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:30,020
permutation. In fact the difference, is
bounded by this quantity here, and since

134
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,700
we said that X is very large, this
quantity Q squared over 2X is negligible.

135
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,876
Okay. That's gonna be our goal. So
essentially, again, when X is large, say

136
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:43,630
two to the 128, Q say is going to be two
to the 32. That's a billion queries that

137
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,443
the adversary makes. Then, still the ratio
is going to be negligible. In which case,

138
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:52,847
we say that the adversary's advantage is
distinguishing the PRP from a random

139
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:58,010
function. It's pretty much the same as its
advantage of distinguishing a PRP from a

140
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,431
random permutation. So, again, it's
basically, if E is already a secure PRP,

141
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:08,844
then it's already a secure PRF. So for
AES, AES, we believe, is a secure PRP.

142
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:14,517
And therefore, AES, we can also use it as a
secure PRF. And so, as a final note, I

143
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,530
just want to mention that, really, from
now on, you can kinda forget about the

144
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,312
inner workings of AES and triple DES.
We're simply gonna assume that both are

145
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:26,218
secure PRPs, and then we're gonna see how
to use them. But whenever I say PRP, or

146
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:30,442
PRF, you should be thinking in your mind,
basically, AES or triple DES.
