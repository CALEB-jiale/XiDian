1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,432
In this module, we're gonna stop talking
about encryption,

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:04,415
and instead discuss message integrity.

3
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:08,987
Next, we will come back to encryption, and show
how to provide both encryption and integrity.

4
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:13,222
So as I said, our goal here is to provide
integrity without any confidentiality.

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,561
There are actually in fact many cases in
the real world where this comes up.

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:19,583
For example, you can think of
operating system files on your disk.

7
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:24,608
Say if you're using Windows, all the Windows
operating system files on disk are not confidential,

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,116
they're public and known to the world,

9
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:30,883
but it is quite important to make sure that
they're not modified by a virus or some malware.

10
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:33,760
That's an example where you want
to provide integrity but you don't

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,127
care about confidentiality. Another
example is banner ads on web pages.

12
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:41,467
The provider of the ads doesn't care
at all if someone copies them

13
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:45,128
and shows them to other people.
So there's no confidentiality issue at all.

14
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,458
But they do care about modifying those ads.

15
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:52,046
So, for example, they do wanna prevent people from
changing the ads into different types of ads.

16
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:57,814
So that's another example where integrity matters
but confidentiality is not important at all.

17
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:59,940
So how do we provide message integrity?

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,980
The basic mechanism is what's called a MAC,
a message authentication code, MAC.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,842
And the way we do it is as follows.
So here we have our friends, Alice and Bob.

20
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:13,783
They have a shared key, K, which is not known
to the attacker, but known to both of them.

21
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:16,868
And there's a public message M that Alice
wants to send to Bob,

22
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:21,743
such that an attacker along the way cannot
modify this message on its way to Bob.

23
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:27,935
The way Alice does it, is by using what's called
a MAC signing algorithm, we'll denote it by S,

24
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:32,558
where the MAC signing algorithm takes
as input the key and the message,

25
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:37,243
and produces a very short tag. The tag could
be like 90 bits or 100 bits, or so on.

26
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:41,905
Even though the message is gigabytes long,
the tag is actually very, very short.

27
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:46,640
Then, she appends the tag to the message
and sends the combination of the two to Bob.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,790
Bob receives the message and the tag,

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,311
and then he runs what's called a MAC
verification algorithm on this tag.

30
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,564
So the MAC verification algorithm takes
as input to the key, the message,

31
00:01:56,564 --> 00:02:01,359
and the tag and it says basically yes or no,
depending on whether the message is valid

32
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,585
or whether it's been tampered with.
Okay, so more precisely, what is a MAC?

33
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,401
Well, we said the MAC basically consists of
two algorithms,

34
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,766
a signing algorithm and a verification algorithm.

35
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:16,214
As usual, they're defined over a key space,
a message space, and a tag space.

36
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,641
And as we said, it's a pair of algorithms.

37
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:22,637
So the signing algorithm will output a
tag in the tag space, and the verification

38
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:27,536
algorithm, basically given the key, the
messages and the tag, will output yes or no.

39
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:31,770
And I want to remind you as usual there are
these consistency requirements, such that

40
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,755
for every K in the key space and for every
message in the message space,

41
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:41,067
it so happens that if I sign a message
using a particular key,

42
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:47,364
and then I verify the tag using the same
key, I shall get yes in response.

43
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:50,915
So this is the standard consistency
requirement which is the analog of

44
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:54,736
the one that we saw for encryption.
Now, one thing I'd like to point out is that

45
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:58,477
integrity really does require a shared
key between Alice and Bob.

46
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:02,121
And, in fact, there's a common mistake
that people make, where they try to

47
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:05,795
provide integrity without actually a
shared key. So here's an example.

48
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:10,554
So consider CRC. CRC stands for cyclic
redundancy check. This is a classic

49
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:14,544
checksum algorithm that's designed to
detect random errors in messages.

50
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:19,636
So imagine, instead of using a key to
generate the tag, Alice basically uses a

51
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:24,162
CRC algorithm which is keyless. Doesn't
take any key, to generate a tag.

52
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,594
And then she appends this tag to the
message, she sends it over to Bob,

53
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:31,984
Bob will basically verify that the CRC is
still correct. In other words, Bob will still

54
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:37,108
verify the tag is equal to CRC(m).
And if so the verification algorithm

55
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:40,454
will say yes, and otherwise the
verification algorithm will say no.

56
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:44,027
So the problem with this is this is
very easy for an attacker to defeat.

57
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:48,173
In other words, an attacker can very easily
modify the message and route,

58
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:51,645
and fool Bob into thinking that the
new message is a valid one.

59
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:55,205
The way the attacker will do it
is he'll cancel the message in the tag.

60
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:58,352
He'll simply block them. And then he'll
produce his own message,

61
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:03,042
M prime, and compute his own CRC
on this message M prime,

62
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,622
and then send the concatenation
of the two over to Bob.

63
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:10,948
Bob will run the verification algorithm,
verification will work properly because

64
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:15,856
in fact the right-hand side is in fact
a valid CRC for the left-hand side.

65
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:19,898
And as a result, Bob would think that this
message came from Alice but in fact its been

66
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:24,980
completely modified by the attacker and had
nothing to do with the original message that Alice sent.

67
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,440
Okay, so the problem is, because CRC
doesn't have a key, there's no difference

68
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,609
between Alice and the attacker. And as a result,
Bob doesn't know where the message came from.

69
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:39,579
Once we introduce a key, now Alice can do
something that the attacker can't do.

70
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,194
And as a result, she might be able to compute a
tag that the attacker can't modify.

71
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:50,166
So the point to remember is that CRC is designed
to detect random errors, not malicious errors.

72
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:55,490
And here our goal is to make sure that even a
malicious attacker cannot modify messages in route.

73
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,390
So next we want to define what it means
for a MAC system to be secure.

74
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,635
So as usual, we define security in terms of the
attacker's power. What can the attacker do?

75
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:08,842
And the attackers goal. What is he trying
to do? So in the case of MACs, the

76
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:13,699
attacker's power is what's called a chosen
message attack. In other words, the

77
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:19,039
attacker can give Alice arbitrary
messages of his choice, m<u>1 to m<u>q,</u></u>

78
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,921
and Alice will compute the tag for him on
those messages, and give him those tags.

79
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:28,070
So again, you might wonder, why
would Alice ever do that?

80
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,796
Why would Alice ever compute the tag on a
message that the attacker gave her?

81
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:35,935
So just like in the case of chosen plaintext
attack, it's very common in the real world,

82
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:40,276
that the attacker can give Alice a message.
Alice will compute the tag on that message,

83
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:45,803
and then the attacker will obtain the resulting tag.
For example, the attacker might send Alice an email.

84
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:50,262
Alice might want to save the email to
disk in a way that will prevent someone

85
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:53,441
from tampering with the disk. So she'll
compute a tag on the message,

86
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:58,798
and save the message and the tag to disk.
Later on, the attacker might steal Alice's disk.

87
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:03,385
And now he's recovered Alice's tag on the
message that he sends to Alice.

88
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:07,670
So this is an example of a chosen message
attack in the real world, where the attacker

89
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,497
actually obtained a tag on a
message that he gave Alice.

90
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:15,796
Okay, so that's what the attacker can do,
basically, this chosen message attack.

91
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:20,441
And what is his goal? Well, his goal is to do
something called an existential forgery.

92
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:26,312
What he's trying to do is to produce some,
some new valid message tag there.

93
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:30,984
Okay, so some message tag pair
that's different from one of the

94
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:34,327
pairs that were given to him during
the chosen message attack.

95
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,788
And if he can do that, then we say that
the system is insecure, and if he can't,

96
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:42,704
then we'll say the system is secure.
So I wanna emphasize this existential

97
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:47,591
forgery means that the attacker cannot
produce a new message/tag pair,

98
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:52,575
even for a message that's completely gibberish.
And again, you might wonder, well,

99
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:55,737
why do we care if the attacker computes
a tag on a message that's gibberish?

100
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:57,697
That's not of any value to the attacker.

101
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:02,220
But we want to build MACs that are
secure under any usage settings.

102
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,741
And there are, in fact cases where, for example,
you might want to compute an integrity tag on

103
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:12,517
a random secret key. In which case, even if the
attacker is able to compute a tag on a completely

104
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:18,365
random message, he might be able to fool
a user into using the wrong secret key.

105
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:22,422
And as a result we want to make sure that
if the MAC is secure, the attacker can't

106
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:26,848
produce a valid tag for any message
whether it's gibberish or sensical.

107
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:31,725
Another property that's implied by the security
definition is if the attacker is given some

108
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:37,691
message tag pair he shouldn't be able to
produce a new tag for the same message.

109
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:42,456
In other words even though there might be
another tag t´ for the same message m,

110
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:48,099
the attacker given m and t shouldn't be able
to find this new t´ and again you

111
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:52,177
might wonder well why do we care the
attacker already has a tag on message M.

112
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:55,774
Why does it matter if he can produce
another tag for the message M he already

113
00:07:55,774 --> 00:08:00,672
has one tag. But as we'll see, there are
actually applications where it's really important

114
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:05,689
that the attacker not to be able to produce
a new tag for a previously signed message.

115
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,360
In particular, this will come up when we
combine encryption and integrity.

116
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,145
So that we are gonna demand that given
one tag in the message it's impossible

117
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:17,226
to find another tag for the same message.
Okay, so now that we understand the

118
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:21,703
intuition of what we are trying to achieve, let's
define it as usual using a more precise game.

119
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:26,180
So here we have two algorithms S and V,
and we have an adversary A,

120
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,589
and the game proceeds as follows.
The challenger as usual just chooses

121
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,833
a random key for the MAC and the adversary
basically does his chosen message attack.

122
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:39,697
So he submits an m1 to the challenger
and receives the tag on that message m1.

123
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:43,897
Then he submits an m2 to the challenger
and receives a tag on that m2.

124
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:48,816
And so on and so forth, until, you know,
he submits Q messages to the adversary and

125
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:53,628
receives Q tags on all those messages. So
that's the chosen message attack part.

126
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:57,216
And then the adversary goes ahead and
tries to do an existential forgery.

127
00:08:57,216 --> 00:09:02,321
Namely, he outputs a message tag pair,
a new message tag pair.

128
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:07,704
We say that he wins the game, in other words
b is equal to 1 means that he wins the game if,

129
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:12,196
first of all, the message tag pair that he
outputs is a valid message tag pair,

130
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:17,593
so the verification algorithm says yes.
And second of all, it's a fresh message tag pair.

131
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:21,168
In other words, it's not one of the message
tag pairs that we gave him before.

132
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:25,339
In other words we say that the attacker lost
the game. Namely b is equal to zero.

133
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:30,855
And as usual we say, we define the advantage
of an adversary as the probability that

134
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:35,267
the challenger outputs one in this game.
We say that the MAC system is secure

135
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:39,564
if for all efficient adversaries the advantage
is negligible. Okay, in other words,

136
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:43,853
no efficient adversary can win this
game with non negligible probability.

137
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:48,799
Alright, that's our definition of secure MACs,
and our goal is to build secure MACs like this.

138
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,529
Before we do that, I wanna ask you two questions.
So the first question is, suppose we have a MAC.

139
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,154
And it so happens that the attacker can
find two message, m0 and m1,

140
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:02,904
that happen to have the same tag
for about half of the keys.

141
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:07,505
In other words, if you choose a key at
random with probability one half, the tag

142
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:12,339
of the message m0 will be the same as the
tag of the message m1. And my question to

143
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:16,072
you is can this be a secure MAC. So I want
to emphasize the attacker doesn't know

144
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:21,832
what the tag on m0 and m1 is. All he knows
is that the two messages happen to have

145
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:27,559
the same tag with probability one half. So
the question is whether this is a secure MAC.

146
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:31,162
So the answer is no, this is not a secure
MAC and the reason is because of

147
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:36,192
the chosen message attack. Essentially the
attacker can ask for the tag on the message

148
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:42,665
m0, then he will receive m0, T from the
challenger and in fact T would be a valid

149
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:49,590
tag for message m0 and then what he would
output as his existential forgery is m1, T

150
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:55,330
and you notice that m1, T is different from
m0, T, so this is a valid existential forgery.

151
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,748
And as a result, the attacker wins
the game with advantage one-half.

152
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:03,968
So we conclude that this MAC is not secure.
The second question I'd like to ask you, is,

153
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:07,378
suppose we have a MAC that happens
to always output a five bit tag.

154
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:11,823
In other words, the tag space for this Mac
happens to be {0,1} to the five.

155
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:17,680
So for every key and for every message, the
signing algorithm will just output a five bit tag.

156
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,949
And the question is, can this MAC be secure?

157
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:26,204
Of course the answer is no, because the
attacker can simply guess the tag.

158
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:28,810
So what he would do is he wouldn't
ask any chosen message attacks.

159
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,324
All he would do, is he would output
an existential forgery as follows.

160
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:39,661
He would just choose a random tag. So
choose a random tag t at random in {0,1}^5,

161
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:45,492
and then he would just output his existential
forgery as say, the message zero and the tag t.

162
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:52,720
And now with probability of 1/2^5, this
tag will be a valid tag for the message zero.

163
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,974
And so the adversary's advantage is
1/32, which is non-negligible.

164
00:11:56,974 --> 00:12:00,573
So this basically says that tags
can't be too short.

165
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:05,759
They have to have some length to them.
And in fact, the typical tag length would be,

166
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:14,704
say 64 bits. or 96 bits, or 128 bits. Here let's
for example use the tags that are 96 bits long.

167
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:19,338
If you try to guess the tag for a message
when the tag is 96 bits the probability of

168
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,726
guessing it correctly is 1/2^96.
So the adversary's advantage would

169
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:28,114
just be 1/2^96 which is negligible.
So now that we understand what MACs are,

170
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,935
I wanna show you a simple application.

171
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:34,193
In particular, let's see how MACs can be
used to protect system files on disk.

172
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:37,831
So imagine that when you install an operating
system, say, when you install Windows on

173
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:42,179
your machine. One of the things that,
Windows does, is it asks the user for a

174
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,444
password, and then derives a key K from
this password. And then for every file

175
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:52,790
that it writes to disk, in this case, the
files would be F1, F2, up to Fn, what the

176
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,123
operating system would do is it
would compute a tag for that file,

177
00:12:56,123 --> 00:13:01,908
and then store the tag along with the file. So here
it concatenates the tag, to each one of the files.

178
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:06,326
And then it erases the key K.
So it no longer stores the key K on disc,

179
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:10,884
or on memory, or anywhere. Okay, so now
later imagine that the machine gets

180
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:15,532
infected with a virus and the virus tries
to modify some of the system files.

181
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:19,154
The question is whether the user can
detect which files were modified.

182
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:24,270
So here's one way to do it. Basically, the user
would reboot the machine into some clean OS.

183
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,868
Say you reboot from a USB disk or something.
And then, once the machine boots from this

184
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:34,052
clean OS, the user would supply his password
to this clean running operating system.

185
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:37,974
And then this new clean running operating
system would go ahead and check the MAC for

186
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:43,279
each one of the system files. Now, the
fact that the MAC is secure, means that

187
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,819
the poor virus couldn't actually create a
new file, let's call it F prime, with a valid tag.

188
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:53,928
So it couldn't actually create an
f´, t´. Because, if it could,

189
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:58,757
then that would be an existential forgery
on this MAC. And because, well,

190
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:02,973
the MAC is existentially unforgeable. The
virus couldn't create any F Prime, no

191
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:07,092
matter what the F Prime is. And
consequently, because of the security of

192
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:10,829
the MAC, the user will detect all the
files that were modified by the virus.

193
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:16,104
Now, there's one caveat to that. One thing
that the virus can do. Is actually swap

194
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:22,190
two files. So, for example, he can swap
this file, file F1, with the file F2 here,

195
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,364
just literally swap them. So when the
system, or when the user, tries to run

196
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:31,126
file F1, instead they'll be running file
F2. And of course that could cause all

197
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:35,475
sorts of damage. And so the way to defend
against that is essentially by placing the

198
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:40,345
file name inside of the MACed area, so in
fact we're computing an integrity check on

199
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:44,658
the file name as well as on the contents
of the file. And as a result, if the virus

200
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:48,602
tries to swap two files, the system will
say hey, the file that's located in

201
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:52,757
position F1 doesn't have the right name
and therefore it will detect that the virus

202
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:56,859
that did the swap even though the MAC
actually verifies. So it is important to

203
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:01,094
remember that MACs can help you defend
against file tampering. Or data tampering

204
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:06,403
in general. But they won't help you defend
against swapping of authenticated data,

205
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:09,725
and that has to be done by some other
means. Okay, so that concludes our

206
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:13,037
introduction to MACs, and in the next
segment, we'll go ahead and construct our

207
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,173
first examples of secure MACs.
