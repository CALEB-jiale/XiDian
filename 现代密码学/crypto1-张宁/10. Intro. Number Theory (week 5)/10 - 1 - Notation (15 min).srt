1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,078
In the last module we saw that number
theory can be useful for key exchange.

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:08,471
In this modlule we will review some basic facts
of number theory that will help us build

3
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:12,759
many public key systems next week. As we
go through the material in this module it

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,047
might help to pause the video from time to
time to make sure all the examples are clear

5
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:21,283
So as I said we're gonna use number
theory to build key exchange protocols.

6
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:26,836
We're gonna use number theory to build
digital signatures, public encryption and many, many other things.

7
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:29,676
But before we can
do all that, we have to review some basic

8
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:33,855
facts from number theory and in fact in
this module we're gonna do a quick course

9
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:38,034
on the relevant concept. If you'd like to
review some of the material discussed in

10
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:41,958
this module offline, I referenced at the
end of the module a free textbook by

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,932
Victor Shoup and I pointed to some
specific chapters in his book that will

12
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:50,897
explain the materials that we will cover
here. So from here on I'm going to use the

13
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:55,832
following notation. I'm going to use
capital N to always denote a positive

14
00:00:55,832 --> 00:01:01,368
integer, and I'm going to use lower case p
to always denote a positive prime number.

15
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:06,503
Now I'd like to introduce the following
notation, there's this funny Z that's

16
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:12,172
written like two diagonal lines here with
a subscript N I'm gonna use that to denote

17
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:16,939
the sets as zero, one, two, up to N minus
one. This is actually a very common

18
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:21,780
notation that's used in Crypto, and so
I'll stick to that here. So again, Z sub N

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,865
denotes the set of integers 0,1 up to N-1. And in fact, this is not just a

20
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:31,890
set of integers. We can do addition and
multiplication in this set as long as we

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,991
always multiply module of the number N.
For those of you who know a little bit of

22
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,853
algebra, I'll just say that Z sub N
denotes a ring where addition and

23
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:45,388
multiplication are done modulo N. This is
very common notation in crypto, although

24
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:49,922
in modern mathematics Z sub N sometimes
denotes something else. But as I said I'm

25
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:54,568
gonna keep on using Z sub N to denote the
set of integers 0 to N-1 with

26
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:59,230
addition and multiplication modulo N. So
I want to make sure everybody's

27
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,551
comfortable with modular arithmetic. And
so let's just look at the number, say, N=12

28
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:09,612
And let's just see some basic facts about modular arithmetic. So

29
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:14,348
I'm gonna say that nine plus eight is
seventeen; seventeen is five modulo

30
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:19,962
twelve, so I'm gonna write that nine plus
eight is equal to five in Z 12. Now

31
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:26,866
can someone tell me how much is five times
seven in Z12? In other words, how much is modular 12?

32
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:33,660
Well, five times seven is 35. And if you recall, 36 is divisible by 12

33
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,805
So five times seven is really -1 module of 12. 35 is minus

34
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:44,491
one module of twelve. But minus one module
of 12 is basically the same as 11,

35
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:49,975
cuz I just add 12  to -1 and I
get 11. And the next question is, how

36
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:56,189
much is 5 - 7 seven in the Z12?
Well, 5-7 is -2.

37
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,828
-2 modulo 12, well, I just add 12
to -2 and I get 10. As a result,

38
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:07,815
we say that 5 - 7 is equal to
10. So again, this is just to make sure

39
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:13,848
everybody is comfortable with this notation of working
in Z12. In other words, working in modulo 12.

40
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:18,856
Now, I'd just like to make a
general statement that, in fact,

41
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:23,034
arithmetic in ZN, in other words,
arithmetic modulo N works just as you

42
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:27,268
would expect. So, for example, all the
laws that you know about addition and

43
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:31,847
multiplication work equally well in ZN.
For example, the distributive law, X times

44
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:36,196
Y plus Z, is still gonna be equal to X
times Y plus X times Z. So many of the

45
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:41,003
things that you know about arithmetic when
working over the integers or in the reals,

46
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:46,247
will translate to working in, ZN, namely
working modulo N.

47
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:51,965
So the next concept we need is what's called a greatest common
divisor, or a GCD. And so suppose they

48
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:57,319
give you two integers X and Y. We say that
the GCD of X and Y is basically the

49
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,880
greatest common divisor it's the largest
number, the largest integer that divides

50
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,138
both X and Y. So for example, what is the
GCD of 12 and 18?

51
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,258
Well the GCD is 6, because 6 divides both 12
and 18,

52
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:18,965
and it's the largest number that divides both 12 and 18.

53
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:27,245
Now
there is an important fact about GCD's in particular, if I give you two numbers, two
integers X and Y, there will always exist

54
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:32,711
two other integers, I will call them A and
B, such that if I look at a times X + B

55
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:38,177
times Y what I get is the GCD of X and Y.
In other words the GCD of X and Y is a

56
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:43,711
linear combination of X and Y using the
integers A and B. So far let us look at a

57
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:49,245
simple example, here, let's look at the
GCD from before, so the integers for the

58
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:55,831
GCD would be 2 times 12 Minus 1
times 18. That's 24 minus 18,

59
00:04:55,831 --> 00:05:02,533
which is equal to 6. So the integers A
and B in this case would be 2 and -1

60
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:08,625
But this is just an example, and in
fact, these integers, A and B will exist

61
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:13,463
for any integers, X and Y. Now not only do
A and B exist, in fact there's a very

62
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:17,838
simple and efficient algorithm to find
these integers, to find A and B. The

63
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:22,627
algorithm is what's called the extended
Euclidean algorithm. This is actually one

64
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:27,416
of the prettiest algorithms from ancient
Greek times, due to Euclid of course. I'm

65
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,672
not gonna show you how this algorithm
works here, I. It's a fairly simple

66
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:36,343
algorithm. I'll just tell that in fact
given X and Y, this algorithm will find A

67
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:40,942
and B in time roughly quadratic in the
logarithms of X and Y. We'll come back to

68
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:44,966
that and discuss the, the performance of
Euclid's algorithm I have a bit more

69
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:49,752
detail in just a minute. But, for now all
we need to know is that A and B can

70
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:55,719
actually be found efficiently. Now, if the
GCD of X and Y happens to be 1. In other

71
00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:00,956
words, 1 is the largest integer that
divides both X and Y, then we say that X

72
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:05,926
and Y are relatively prime. For example,
the GCD of three and five, it's not

73
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:11,567
difficult to see that it hap, that happens
to be 1, Because both 3 and 5 are

74
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:15,688
prime. The next topic we need to talk
about is modulated inversion. So other

75
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:20,214
than rationals we know what the inverse of
a number is. In other words if I give you

76
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:24,130
the number 2 the inverse of 2 is
simply the fraction one half.

77
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,111
the qestion is what about inverses when we, we
work module N. Well, so the inverse of

78
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:37,475
an element X in Z N is simply another
element Y in Z N such that X times Y is

79
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:43,650
equal to 1 in Z N. In other words X
times Y is equal to 1 modulo N. And this

80
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,066
number Y is denoted by X inverse. And it's
not difficult to see that if, if Y exists,

81
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:54,351
then in fact it's unique. And as I said,
we'll use X inverse to denote the inverse

82
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:59,440
of X. So let's look at a quick example.
Suppose N is some odd integer, and I ask

83
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,636
you what is the inverse of 2 in ZN?
So it's not too difficult to see that the

84
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:09,810
inverse of two in ZN in fact is N plus one
over 2 and you can see that this is an

85
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,429
integer because N is odd, therefore, N+1 is even and, therefore, (N+1)/2

86
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:19,542
is in fact an integer and the
range 1..N as required. Now why is (N+1)/2

87
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:24,407
the inverse of two?
Well, let's just multiply the 2 so we do

88
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:29,273
2 times (N+1) over 2 and what do
we get? Well, that's simply equal to N+1

89
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:34,508
and N+1 is simply equal to
1 in ZN. So since their product is equal

90
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:38,889
to 1. We know that (N+1)/2
is the inverse of 2 in ZN.

91
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,174
Now we understand what a modular inverse is, the
question is which elements actually have

92
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:48,853
an inverse in ZN? And so there's a very
simple lemma that says that if for an

93
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:53,911
element X in ZN, that element has
an inverse if and only if it is relatively

94
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:58,500
prime to the modulus N, to the number N.
So I'll say that again. X and ZN is

95
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,607
invertible if and only if X is relatively
prime to N. And let's quickly prove that.

96
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:08,403
It's actually fairly simple to see. So
suppose a GCD of X and N happens to be

97
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:13,262
equal to one. So X is relatively prime to
N. Well, by this property of GCD as we

98
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:18,120
know that there exists integers A and B.
Such that A times X plus B times N is

99
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,469
equal to the GCD of X and N, which happens
to be one. So A times X plus B times N is

100
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:28,778
equal to 1. Now we can actually take
this equation here and, and us it reduce

101
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:34,360
it's modulo N. So what this means is that
a times X is equal to one in Z, N. Once we

102
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,669
reduce this equation modulo N this term
simply falls off because B times N is

103
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:46,059
divisible by N and therefore is 0
modulo N. But what we just showed is that

104
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:52,763
in fact X inverse is simply A in ZN. So
because X is relatively prime to N, we

105
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:58,700
were able to show that X is invertible by
actually building the inverse of X modulo N

106
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,349
Now what about the other direction?
What happens if the GCD is greater than 1?

107
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:08,339
Then we want to show that there is no
inverse. But that's actually very easy to

108
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,908
see because in this case, if you claim
that A happens to be the inverse of X

109
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:17,658
modulo N, well, let's look at a<i>x; a<i>X we know should be equal to 1 modulo N</i></i>

110
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:22,467
But if the GCD(X,N) is
bigger than 1, then the GCD(a<i>X,N)</i>

111
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:27,157
is bigger than one. But, if the GCD
of A times X and N is bigger than 1,

112
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:32,366
then it's not possible that A<i>X is
equal to 1. So A<i>X must also be</i></i>

113
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:38,436
bigger than 1, and therefore, A cannot
be the inverse of X module N.

114
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:42,602
So this proves that, in fact, in, when the GCD is
greater than 1, X cannot have an

115
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:47,282
inverse, because there is no A, such that
A times X is equal to one modulo N

116
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:51,791
And this might be a bit confusing, so you
might be best just to, do an example. So

117
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,451
let's look at, let's suppose that the GCD
of X and N happens to be equal to 2.

118
00:09:56,451 --> 00:10:01,843
I claim that X is therefore, is not
invertible modular N. Well, why is that

119
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:07,615
true? Well, for all A, we know that A
times X is gonna be even, is even. And the

120
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:13,471
reason we know that is because, well, 2
divides X and 2 divides N. Well, since

121
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:18,501
two divide X, 2 is also gonna divide A
times X. And therefore, A times X must be

122
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:23,468
even. But what that means is that there's
no way that A times X is equal to 1 modulo N

123
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:28,649
In particular, there's no way
that A times X is equal to B times N + 1

124
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,749
This simply can't happen, this
equality must not hold. Because this side

125
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:39,257
happens to be even, as we said. B times N
for exactly the same reason is also even:

126
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:44,832
N is divisible by two; therefore B times N
is also divisible by two. So therefore B

127
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:50,340
times N+1 is odd. And since even
can't equal to odd, it's not possible that

128
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,297
A times X is equal to some multiple of N+1. And in particular this means

129
00:10:56,297 --> 00:11:01,331
that A cannot be the inverse of X because
A times X cannot be 1 mod N so X is not

130
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:05,308
invertible modular N. So now we have a
complete understanding of what are the

131
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:09,192
invertible elements. Basically, we know
that an element is invertible if and only

132
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:13,270
if it's relatively prime to N. And what I
like about this proof is I would say this

133
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,623
is what's called a computer-science proof
In the sense that not only does it prove

134
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:22,250
to you that the inverse exists; it also
shows you how to efficiently calculate the

135
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,312
inverse. And the way we calculate the
inverse, is basically by using this

136
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:30,826
extending decreasing algorithm. Define the
numbers A and B. And once we found the

137
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:35,453
numbers A and B, we done because A is the
inverse of X. And the numbers A and B can

138
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:41,269
be found very efficiently. So along the
way I've also shown you an algorithm for

139
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,768
inverting elements, modulo N.

140
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:53,243
Okay. So
bear with me, and let's introduce this little more notation. So we're gonna denote by ZN as the set of invertible elements in

141
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:58,439
Z N. In other words, ZN is the set
of all elements in ZN such that GCD(X,N)=1

142
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,930
Okay. But I want you, again, to think of ZN as

143
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,736
basically those elements in ZN that have
an inverse. So let's look at a few

144
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:12,859
examples. So let's start with a prime p.
We know that of the integers from zero to

145
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:17,350
p-1, all of them are gonna be
relatively primed to p except one

146
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,409
integer--namely, the integer 0. Zero is
not relatively primed to P, because the

147
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:27,719
GCD(p,0)=0, not 1. So
therefore, if p is a prime, the set ZP

148
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:34,196
is simply ZP minus 0, Which means
that everything in Z<u>P is invertible</u>

149
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:41,093
except for 0. So if you like the size
of ZP<i>, it's simply P-1. Now</i>

150
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:46,230
let's look at our favorite integer again.
So why don't you tell me what is Z12

151
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,036
what is the set of invertible elements modulo 12?

152
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:57,226
And the answer, of course, is all the numbers
that are relatively primed to 12--namely,

153
00:12:57,226 --> 00:13:01,839
1, 5, 7, and 11. So, for
example, 3, 4, 6--all of those are

154
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,802
not invertible because they all have a, a
non-trivial GCD with twelve, And as we

155
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:11,085
said before, if I give you an element X
and ZN<i>, you can find its inverse</i>

156
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:15,476
using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
You can find its inverse very efficiently,

157
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:19,760
in fact, using this algorithm. So what we
just learned is basically how to solve

158
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,205
modular linear equations. In other words,
if I give you a linear equation and I ask

159
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:28,543
you to solve it mod N, it's actually very
easy to do. All you do is you move B to

160
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:32,826
the other side so you have a minus B, and
then you multiply by A inverse. So the

161
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:37,217
answer is minus B times A inverse. And you
can find A inverse using the Euclidean

162
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:41,585
algorithm. And once you have a inverse,
you'd simply multiply it by minus B,

163
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:46,188
modulo N, and that gives you the solution
to this linear equation. Now the

164
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:51,149
Euclidian algorithm actually takes time
that's quadratic in logarithm of N. So it

165
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,690
takes time proportional to log squared N.
And as a result we say that this is a

166
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,980
quadratic algorithm for solving linear
equations, modulo N, and if fact this is

167
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,876
the best know algorithm. And so if you
think back to your high-school algebra

168
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:08,692
days, after you learned how to solve
linear equations, the next question was,

169
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:12,305
well, what about quadratic equations. And
that problem is actually quite

170
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:15,460
interesting, and we're gonna see that in
the next few segments.
