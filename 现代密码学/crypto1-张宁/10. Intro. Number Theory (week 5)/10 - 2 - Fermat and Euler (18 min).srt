1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
In the previous segment we talked about
modular inversion and we said the Euclid's

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,238
algorithm gives us an efficient way to
find the inverse of an element modulo N.

3
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:12,256
In this segment we're going to forward
through time and we're going to move to

4
00:00:12,256 --> 00:00:15,866
the seventeenth and eighteenth century
where we're going to talk about

5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:19,986
Fermat and Euler contributions.
Before that let's do a quick review of

6
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:24,257
what we discussed in the previous segment.
So as usual I'm going to let N denote the

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:28,427
positive integer and let's just say that N
happens to be a n-bit integer, in other

8
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:32,445
words it's between two to the n and two to
the n+1, as usual we're going to let P

9
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:36,761
denote a prime. Now we said that
ZN is a set of integers from zero

10
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:41,370
to N-1 and we said that we can add and
multiply elements in the set modulo N. We

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,186
also said that ZN star is basically the
set of invertible elements in ZN. And we

12
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:51,243
proved a simple lemma to say that, X is
invertible if and only if X is relatively

13
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:55,879
prime to N. And not only did we
completely understand which elements are

14
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,635
invertible and which aren't, we also
showed a very efficient algorithm based on

15
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:05,572
Euclid's extended algorithm, to find the
inverse of an element X in ZN. And we said

16
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:10,388
that the running time of this algorithm,
is basically order n squared, where

17
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:16,107
again, n is the number of bits of the
number capital N. So as I said, now

18
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:21,037
we're going to move from Greek times all
the way to the seventeenth century and

19
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:26,276
talk about Fermat. So Fermat did a number
of important theorems. The one that I want

20
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:31,206
to show you here today is the following.
So suppose I give you a prime P. Then in

21
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:36,260
fact for any element X in ZP star, it so
happens that if I look at X and raise it

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,130
to the power of P - 1, I'm a gonna get
one, in ZP. So let's look at a quick

23
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,061
example. Suppose I set the number P to be
five. And I look at, three to the power of

24
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:50,645
P-1. In other words, three to the power of
four, Three to the power of four is 81,

25
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:55,286
which in fact, is one modulo five. This
example satisfies Fermat's theorem.

26
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:59,521
Interestingly, Fermat actually didn't prove this theorem himself. The proof

27
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:04,337
actually waited until Euler, who
proved that almost 100 years later. And in

28
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:09,122
fact, he proved a much more general
version of this theorem. So let's look at

29
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:14,154
a simple application of Fermat's theorem.
Suppose I look at an element X in Z P

30
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:19,441
star. And I want to remind you here that P
[inaudible] must be a prime. Well, then what do we

31
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:24,664
know? We know that X to the P minus one is
equal to one. Well, we can write X to the

32
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:29,573
P minus one as X times X to the power of P
minus two. Well so now we know that X

33
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:34,087
times X to the power of P minus two
happens to be equal to one. And what that

34
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:39,310
says, is that really the inverse of X
modulo P, is simply X to the P minus two.

35
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,042
So this gives us another algorithm for
finding the inverse of X modulo a prime.

36
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:48,835
Simply raise X to the power of p minus
two, and that will give us the inverse of

37
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:53,508
x. It turns out, actually this is a fine
way to compute inverses modulo a prime.

38
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:58,301
But it has two deficiencies compared to
Euclid's algorithm. First of all, it only

39
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:02,528
works modulo primes, Whereas, Euclid's
algorithm worked modulo composites as

40
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,017
well. And second of all, it turns out this
algorithm is actually less efficient. When

41
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:10,911
we talk about how to do modular
exponentiations--we're gonna do that in

42
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:15,345
the last segment in this module--you'll
see that the running time to compute this

43
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:19,792
exponentiation is actually cubic in the
size of P. So this will take roughly log

44
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:24,266
cube of P, whereas if you remember,
Euclid's algorithm was able to compute the

45
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:30,343
inverse in quadratic time in the
representation of P. So not only is this

46
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:36,512
algorithm less general it only works for
primes, it's also less efficient. So score

47
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:41,473
one for Euclid. But nevertheless, this
fact about primes is extremely important,

48
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:47,506
and we're gonna be making extensive use of
it in the next couple of weeks. So let me

49
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:52,155
show you a quick and simple application
for Fermat's theorem suppose we wanted

50
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:57,226
to generate a large random prime, say our
prime needed to be 1,000 bits or so. So

51
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:02,006
the prime we're looking for is on the
order of two to the 1024 [inaudible]. So here's

52
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:06,724
a very simple probabilistic algorithm.
What we would do is we would choose a

53
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:11,938
random integer in the interval that was
specified. And then we would test whether

54
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:17,153
this integer satisfies Fermat's theorem.
In other words, we would test for example

55
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:22,367
using the base two; we would test whether
two to the power of p minus one equals one

56
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:27,271
in Z p. If the answer is no, then if this
equality doesn't hold, then we know for

57
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:33,003
sure that the number p that we chose is
not a prime. And if that happens, all we

58
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:37,284
do is we go back to step one and we try
another prime. And we do this again and

59
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:41,782
again and again, until finally we find an
integer that satisfies this condition. And

60
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:46,009
once we find an integer that satisfies
this condition, we simply output it and

61
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,573
stop. Now it turns out, this is actually a
fairly difficult statement to prove. But

62
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:56,305
it turns out if a random number passes
this test, then it's extremely likely to

63
00:04:56,305 --> 00:05:01,398
be a prime. In particular the probability
that P is not a prime is very small. It's

64
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:06,191
like less than two to the -60 for the
range of 1024 bit numbers. As the

65
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:10,744
number gets bigger and bigger the
probability that it passes this test here,

66
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:15,716
but is not a prime drops to zero very
quickly. So this is actually quite an

67
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:20,455
interesting algorithm. You realize we're
not guaranteed that the output is in fact

68
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:25,021
a prime. All we know is that it's very,
very likely to be a prime. In other words

69
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:29,587
the only way that it's not a prime is that
we got extremely unlucky. In fact so

70
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:34,298
unlucky that a negligible probability
event just happened. Another way to say

71
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:40,230
this is that if you look at the set of all
1024 integers, then, well, there's the set

72
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,233
of primes. Let me write prime here. And
then there is a small number of

73
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:50,805
composites. That actually will falsify the
test. Let's call them F for false primes.

74
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:55,653
Let's call them FP, for false primes.
There's a very small number of composites

75
00:05:55,653 --> 00:06:00,626
that are not prime and yet will pass this
test. But as we choose random integers,

76
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:05,349
you know, we choose one here, one here,
one here, and so on, as we choose random

77
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,260
integers, the probability that we fall
into the set of false primes is so small

78
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,082
That it's essentially a negligible event
that we can ignore. In other words, one

79
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:20,591
can prove that the set of false primes is
extremely small, and a random choice is

80
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:25,266
unlikely to pick such a false prime. Now I
should mention, in fact, this is a very

81
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:28,960
simple algorithm for generating primes.
It's actually, by far, not the best

82
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,654
algorithm. We have much better algorithms
now. And, in fact, once you have a

83
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:36,349
candidate prime, we now have very
efficient algorithms that will actually

84
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:40,498
prove beyond a doubt that this candidate
prime really is a prime. So we don't even

85
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:44,597
have to rely on probabilistic statements.
But nevertheless, this Fermat test is so

86
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:48,595
simple, that I just wanted to show you
that it's an easy way to generate primes.

87
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:53,076
Although in reality, this is not how
primes are generated. As the last point,

88
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:57,468
I'll say that you might be wondering how
many times this iteration has to repeat

89
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:01,536
until we actually find the prime. And
that's actually a classic result; it's

90
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:05,820
called the prime number theorem, which
says that, after a few hundred iterations,

91
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,833
in fact, we'll find the prime with
high probability. So in expectation, one would

92
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,771
expect a few hundred iterations and no
more. Now that we understand

93
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:19,314
Fermat's theorem, the next thing I want
to talk about is what's called the

94
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:23,915
structure of ZP star. So here, we are
going to move 100 years into the future...

95
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:28,576
Into the eighteenth century and look at
the work of Euler. And one of the first

96
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:33,118
things Euler showed is in modern language
is that ZP star is what's called a

97
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:38,014
cyclic group. What does it mean that ZP
star is a cyclic group? What it means is

98
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:42,734
that there exists some element G in ZP
star, such that if we take G and raise to

99
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:47,681
a bunch of powers G, G squared, G cubed, G
to the fourth. And so on and so forth up

100
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:52,590
until we reach G to the P minus two.
Notice there's no point of going beyond G

101
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,296
to the p minus two, because G to the p
minus one by Fermat's theorem is equal to

102
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:02,178
one, so then we will cycle back to one. If
we go back to G to the p minus one, then G

103
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:06,825
to the p will be equal to G, G to the p
plus one will be equal to G squared, and

104
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:11,825
so on and so forth. So we'll actually get
a cycle if we keep raising to higher and

105
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:16,590
higher powers of G. So we might as well
stop at the power of G to the p minus two.

106
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,413
And what Euler showed is that in fact
there is an element G such that if you

107
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:26,300
look at all of its powers all of its
powers expand the entire group ZP Star.

108
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,239
The powers of G give us all the elements
in ZP star. Elements of this, of this type

109
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:35,997
is called a generator. So G would be said
to be a generator of ZP star. So let's

110
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:40,696
look at a quick example. So let's look,
for example, at P equals seven. And let's

111
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:45,575
look at all the powers of three. So three
squared three cubed, three to the fourth,

112
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:50,130
three to the fifth, Three to the six,
already we know, is equal to one modular

113
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,917
seven by Fermat's Theorem. So there's no
point in looking at three to the six. We

114
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:59,644
know we would just get one. So here, I
calculated all these powers for you, and I

115
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:04,431
wrote them out. And you see that in fact,
we get all the numbers [inaudible] in Z,

116
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:09,313
in Z7 star. In other words, we get
one, two, three, four, five, and six. So

117
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:14,599
we would say that three is a generator of
Z7 star. Now I should point out that not

118
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:19,886
every element is a generator. For example,
if we look at all the powers of two, well,

119
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:24,914
that's not gonna generate the entire
group. In particular, if we look at two to

120
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:29,650
the zero, we get one. Two to the one, we
get two. Two squared is four, and two

121
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,455
cubed is eight, which is one modular
seven. So we cycled back and then two to

122
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:39,766
the fourth would be two, two to the fifth
would be four. And so on and so forth. So

123
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:44,697
if we look at the powers of two, we just
get one, two, and four. We don't get the

124
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:49,981
whole group and therefore we say that two
is not a generator of Z7 star. Now again,

125
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:55,831
something that we'll use very often is
given an element G of ZP<i>, if we look at a</i>

126
00:09:55,831 --> 00:10:01,901
set of all powers of G, the resulting set
is gonna be called the group generated by

127
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:06,947
G, okay? So these are all the powers of G.
They give us what's called a

128
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:12,798
multiplicative group. Again, the technical
term doesn't matter. The point is we're

129
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:18,397
gonna call all these powers of G, the
group generated by G. In fact there's this

130
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:23,570
notation which I don't use very often,
angle G angle, to denote this group that's

131
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:30,010
generated by G. And then we call the order
of G in Z p star, we simply let that be

132
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,663
the size of the group that's generated by
G. So in other words, the order of G in Z

133
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:40,626
p star is the size of this group. But
another way to think about that is

134
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:46,280
basically it's the smallest integer A such
that G to the A is equal to one in Z P.

135
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,838
Okay, it's basically the smallest power
that causes the power of G to be equal to

136
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:58,566
one. And it's very easy to see that this
equality here basically if we look at all

137
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:04,024
the powers of G and we look at one, G, G
squared, G cubed and so on and so forth up

138
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:09,887
until we get to G to the order of G minus
one. And then if we look at the order of G

139
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:15,420
to the order of G. This thing is simply
going to be equal to one, by definition.

140
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay, so there's no point in looking at
any higher powers. We might as well just

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,631
stop raising to powers here. And as a
result the size of the set, in fact, is

142
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:33,263
the order of G. And you can see that the
order is the smallest power such that

143
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:38,931
raising G to that power gives us one in Z
p. So I hope this is clear although it

144
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:43,455
might take a little bit of thinking to
absorb all this notation. But in the

145
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:48,100
meantime let's look at a few examples. So,
again, let's fix our, our prime to be

146
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,986
seven. And let's look at the order of the
number of elements. So what is the order

147
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:57,752
of three modulus of seven? Well, we're
asking what is the size of the group that

148
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:02,759
three generates modulus of seven? Well, we
said that three is a generator of Z7 star.

149
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,705
So it generates all of Z7 star. There are
six elements in Z7 star. And therefore we

150
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:12,758
say that the order of three is equal to
six. Similarly, I can ask, well, what is

151
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:17,421
the order of two modulo seven? And in
fact, we already saw the answer. So let's,

152
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:22,084
I'll ask you, what is the order of two
modulo seven and see if you can f igure

153
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:28,549
out what this answer is. So the answer is
three and again, the reason is if we look

154
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:33,618
at the set of powers of two modulo seven,
we have one, two, two squared, and then

155
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:39,077
two cubed is already equal to one. So this
is the entire set of powers of two modulo

156
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:44,211
seven. There are only three of them and,
therefore, the order of two modulo seven

157
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:49,215
is exactly three. Now let me ask you a
trick question. What's the order of one

158
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:54,499
modulo seven? Well, the answer is one.
Because if you look at the group that's

159
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:58,633
generated by one, well, there's only one
number in that group, namely the number

160
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:02,608
one. If I raise one to a whole bunch of
powers, I'm always gonna get one, And

161
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:07,060
therefore the order of 1 modulo 7
In fact the order of 1 modulo any prime

162
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,518
is always gonna be 1. Now there's an
important theorem of Lagrange, that

163
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:17,137
actually this is a very, very special case
of it, what I am stating here. But

164
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:22,309
Langrage's theorem basically implies that
if you look at the order of G modulo p,

165
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:27,112
the order is always going to divide P-1. So in our two example you see,

166
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:32,100
six divides seven minus one, six divides
six, and similarly, three divides seven

167
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,026
minus one. Namely again three divides six.
But this is very general; your order is

168
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:41,333
always going be a factor of P minus one.
In fact, I'll tell you, maybe it's a

169
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:45,177
puzzle for you to think about. It's
actually very easy to deduce Fermat's

170
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:49,179
theorem directly from this fact, from this
Lagrange's theorem in fact. And so

171
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:53,340
Fermat's theorem really in some sense
follows directly from Lagrange's theorem.

172
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,375
Lagrange, by the way, did his work in the
nineteenth century, so you can already see

173
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:04,053
how we're making progress through time. We
started in Greek times, and already we

174
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:09,376
ended up in the nineteenth century. And I
can tell you that more advanced crypto

175
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:14,024
actually uses twentieth century math very
extensively. Now that we understand the

176
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:18,416
structure of ZP star, let's generalize
that to composites, and look at the

177
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:23,471
structure of ZN star. So what I wanna show
you here is what's called Euler's Theorem

178
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:28,044
which is a, a direct generalization of
Fermat's Theorem. So, Euler defined the

179
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:32,978
following function. So given an integer N,
he defined what's called the phi

180
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:37,190
function, phi of M, to be
basically the size of the set ZN star.

181
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,686
This is sometimes called, Euler's phi
function. The size of the set Z N star. So

182
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:48,521
for example, we already looked at Z twelve
star. We said that Z twelve star contains

183
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:53,881
these four elements, one, five, seven, and
eleven. And therefore we say that phi of

184
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:59,310
twelve is simply the number four. So let
me ask you as a puzzle, what is phi of P?

185
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:06,266
It will basically be the size of Z P star.
And so, in fact, we said that in the Z P

186
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:12,335
star contains all of Z P except for the
number zero. And therefore, phi of P for

187
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:18,533
any prime P is gonna be P minus one. Now,
there is a special case, which I'm gonna

188
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:23,282
state here and we're gonna use later for
the RSA system. If N happens to be a

189
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:28,277
product of two primes, then phi of N is
simply N minus P minus Q plus one. And let

190
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:33,045
me just show you why that's true. So
basically N is the size of Z N. And now we

191
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:37,838
need to remove all the elements that are
not relatively prime to m. Well how can an

192
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:42,632
element not be relatively prime to m? It's
gotta be divisible by p or it's gotta be

193
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:47,079
divisible by q. Well how many elements
between zero and m minus one are there,

194
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,757
there that are divisible by p? Well there
are exactly q of them. How many elements

195
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:55,973
are there that are divisible by q. Well
there are exactly p of them. So we

196
00:15:55,973 --> 00:16:00,593
subtract p to get rid of those divisible
by q. We subtract q to get rid of those

197
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:05,776
divisible by p. And you notice we
subtracted zero twice, because zero is

198
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:12,020
divisible both by P and Q. And therefore,
we add one just to make sure we subtract

199
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,264
zero only once. And so it's not difficult
to see that phi(N) is N-P-Q+1. And another way

200
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:24,599
of writing that is simply (P-1) times (Q-1). Okay,
so this is a fact that we will use later

201
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:30,275
on, when we come back and talk about the
RSA system. So far, this is just defining

202
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:35,690
this phi function of Euler. But now Euler
put this phi function to really good use.

203
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,104
And what he proved is this amazing fact
here that basically says that if you give

204
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:46,060
me any element X in Z N star. In fact, and
it so happens that X to the power of phi(N)

205
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,678
is equal to one in Z N. So you can see
that this is a generalization of Fermat's

206
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:55,239
theorem; in particular, Fermat's theorem
only applied to primes. For primes we know

207
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:59,913
that phi(p) is equal to p minus one, and
in other words if N were prime we would

208
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:04,494
simply write p minus one here, and then we
would get exactly Fermat's theorem. The

209
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:08,892
beauty of Euler's theorem is that it
applies to composites, and not just

210
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:16,462
primes. So let's look at some examples. So
let's look at five to the power of phi(12).

211
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:21,743
So five is an element of Z12 star.
If we raise it to the power of five of

212
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:27,155
twelve, we should be getting one. Well, we
know that phi(12) is 4, so we're

213
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:32,037
raising 5 to the power of 4. Five to
the power of four is 625 and it's a simple

214
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:36,227
calculation to show that that's equal to
1 modulo 12. So this is proof

215
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:40,468
by example but of course it's not a proof
at all. It's just an example. But in fact

216
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:44,555
it's not difficult to prove Euler's
theorem and in fact I'll tell you that

217
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:48,900
Euler's theorem is also a very special
case of Lagrange's general theorem.

218
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,888
Okay so we say that this is a
generalization of Fermat's theorem and

219
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:58,230
in fact as we'll see this Euler's
theorem is the basis of the RSA crypto

220
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,922
system. So I stop here and we continue
with modular quadratic equations in the

221
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:04,740
next segment.
