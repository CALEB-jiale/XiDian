1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
So now we're gonna look at a very general
paradigm called the Merkle-Damgard

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,668
paradigm, that's used for constructing
collision-resistant hash functions. Before

3
00:00:07,668 --> 00:00:11,526
we do that, let me just remind you what
our goals are. So as usual we say that H

4
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:15,483
is a hash function that maps some large
message space into a small tag space. And

5
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:19,195
we say that a collision for a hash
function is basically a pair of distinct

6
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:23,053
messages that happen to map to the same
value under this hash function. And our

7
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:27,205
goal is to build collision-resistant hash
functions namely functions where it's hard

8
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:30,974
to find even a single collision. Even
though we know many collisions exist. No

9
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:35,090
efficient algorithm can even output a
single collision. So we're gonna construct

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,948
these hash functions, these collision
resistant hash functions, in two steps.

11
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:43,064
The first step, which we're gonna do in
this segment, is to show that if you give

12
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:47,437
me a collision resistant hash function for
short messages, we can extend it and build

13
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:51,427
a collision resistant hash function for
much, much, much longer messages. In the

14
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:54,946
next segment, we'll actually build
collision-resistant HASH functions for

15
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:59,219
short messages. Okay so let's look at the
construction. The construction is actually

16
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,924
very general and in fact all
collision-resistant hash functions follow

17
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:06,891
this paradigm. It's actually a very
elegant paradigm and let me show you how

18
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:10,545
it works. So here we have our function H
which we're gonna assume is a

19
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:14,869
collision-resistant hash function for
small sized inputs. So the way we're gonna

20
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,565
use this little function h, this h is
sometimes called a compression function,

21
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:24,319
is we're gonna take a big message M and
break this message in to blocks. And then

22
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,991
we use a fixed value called the IV. Here
is the case the IV is fixed forever. And

23
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:33,496
it's basically embedded in the code and in
the standards, it's just a fixed ID that's

24
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:37,788
part of the fin-nation of the function.
And then what we do is we apply the small

25
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:41,709
compression function H to the first
message block along with this ID. What

26
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:45,948
comes out of that is what's called a
chaining variable that's gonna be fed into

27
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:50,028
the next compression function which
compresses the next block along with the

28
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:54,320
previous chaining variable and out comes
the next chaining variable, and the next

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,772
message block is compresses, and so on and
so forth until we which the final message

30
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:03,087
block And then the final message block,
the one special thing that we do, is that

31
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:07,246
we must append this padding block, this
PB, which stands for padding block (and

32
00:02:07,246 --> 00:02:11,567
I'll explain what the padding block is in
just a second). But after we append the

33
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:16,104
padding block we again compress the last
[inaudible] variable with the last message

34
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:20,124
block, and the output of that is the
actual output of the hash function. So

35
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:25,232
just to summarize, in symbols, we have
this compression function that elements in

36
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:29,468
T. This is the opposite of the hash
function. Plus message blocks, this x

37
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:34,169
corresponds to message blocks, and outputs
the next chaining variables. So as I said,

38
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:38,982
this is what the compression functions do.
And then from this compression function

39
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:43,625
we're able to build a hash function for
large inputs, namely inputs is the space x

40
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:48,099
to some power of l namely up to l blocks
of x. And of course these are variable

41
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,686
lengths so we could have different length
messages that are being given input to

42
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:57,193
this function h and what comes out of it
is basically a tag in tag space. So the

43
00:02:57,193 --> 00:03:01,456
only thing left to define is the padding
block. So the padding block is actually

44
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:05,719
very important as we're gonna see in just
a minute. What it is, is basically, well

45
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,089
it's a sequence of 1000 that denotes the
end of the actual message block. And then

46
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:14,460
the most important part of the message
block is that we encode the message length

47
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,879
In this padding block. And the message
length field is basically fixed to be 64

48
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,186
bits. So in all the [inaudible] hash
functions, so in all the [inaudible] hash

49
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:27,828
functions the maximum message length is
two to the sixty four minus one so in fact

50
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:32,247
the message length fits into a 64 bit
block. An upper bound of two to the sixty

51
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:36,778
four minus one bit on the message length
is actually sufficiently long to handle

52
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:41,071
all of the messages we're gonna throw at
it. Okay, so that's the padding block, and

53
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:45,130
of course the question is: what do we do
if the last block really is a multiple of

54
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,190
the compression function of block length?
Where are we gonna fit the padding block?

55
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,380
And the answer, as usual, is basically if
there's no space for the padding block in

56
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,003
the last block of the message, then we're
gonna have to ass another dummy block and

57
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:02,561
stick the padding block in there. And of
course put the one zero, zero, zero in the

58
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:07,062
right place. Okay so the point is that
it's very, very important that the padding

59
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:11,507
block contains the message length as we'll
see in just a minute. So this is the

60
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:16,065
Merkle-Damgard construction, the last
piece of terminology I'll say is that we

61
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:20,285
have these chaining variables. So H0 is
the initial value. H1, H2, H3, up to H4

62
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:24,881
which is the actual final output of this
hash function. So as I said, all standard

63
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:29,443
hash functions follow this paradigm for
constructing a collision resistant hash

64
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:33,966
function from a compression function. The
reason that this paradigm is so popular is

65
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:37,673
because of the following theorem, which
says basically that if the little

66
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:41,373
compression function is collision
resistant, then the big Merkle-Damgard

67
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,493
hash function is also collision resistant.
So, in other words, if we're going to build

68
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,607
collision resistant functions for large inputs, all
we have to do is just build compression

69
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:53,771
functions that are collision resistant. So
let's prove this theorem. It's a elegant

70
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:57,732
proof and it's not too difficult. So the
way we're gonna prove it is using the

71
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:01,794
contrapositive, that is, if you can find
me a collision on the big hash function

72
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:06,107
then we're gonna deduce a collision on the
little compression function. Therefore, if

73
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:10,460
little h is a collision resistant, so will
be the big H. So suppose you give me a

74
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,085
collision on the big compression function,
namely two distinct messages M and M',

75
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:19,492
that happen to hash to the same output,
we're going to use M and M' to build

76
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:23,854
a collision on the little compression
function. So the first thing is we

77
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:28,645
have to remember how the Merkle-Damgard
construction works and, in particular,

78
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:33,872
let's assign names to the chain variables
when we hash M versus when we hash M'.

79
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:38,787
So here are the chain variables that come up
when we hash the message M, so H0 is the

80
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:43,952
fixed IV that starts the whole process, H1
would be the result of hashing the first

81
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:48,932
message block with the IV, and so on and
so forth, until H sub t+1 is the

82
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,945
final chain variable, which is the final
output of the Merkle-Damgard chain. And

83
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:59,401
then similarly for M', let's define H0'
to be the first chaining variable, H1'

84
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:04,668
to be the result after compressing
the first message block of M', and so

85
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:09,997
on and so forth, up until we get to H'
of r+1, which is the final hash of

86
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:14,820
the message M'. Now you notice the
length of the messages M and M'

87
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,654
don't have to be the same. In particular, M
has length t, whereas M' has length r.

88
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:24,876
Now because the collision occurred, we
know that these two values here are the

89
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:29,067
same. H(M) is equal to H(M'). In
other words, the last chaining variables

90
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:33,416
are actually equal to one another. So now
let's look carefully how H t+1 and

91
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:37,389
H' r+1 were calculated. Well
H t+1 is calculated as the

92
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,780
compression function applied to the
previous chaining variable along with the

93
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,002
last message block of M, including the
padding block. You'll notice here I'm

94
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:50,618
assuming that the padding block fits with
the last message block of M even if the

95
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:55,121
last padding block is in its own block,
it's not going to make any difference. So

96
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:59,512
for simplicity, let's assume that the
padding block fits with the last message

97
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:03,960
block with capital M. So, by hashing the
last message block with a padding block

98
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,547
and the last chaining variable, we obtain
H t+1 and, similarly, the same thing

99
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:12,922
happens with M'. By hashing the last
message block, the last chaining variable,

100
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:17,350
we obtain H' r+1. And we know
that, since these two values are equal, all

101
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,778
of a sudden we have a candidate collision
for the compression function. Here, let me

102
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:26,099
circle the candidate collision, this is one
part of it and this is the other part of

103
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,072
it. Okay, so we have an equality
between two arguments given to the

104
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:34,405
compression function that happen to
produce the same value. The only way we

105
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:38,853
would not get a collision is if the
arguments happen to be the same. In other

106
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:43,533
words, what we're seeing here is if the
arguments to the compression function are

107
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,750
distinct, then we get a collision for
little h. So let's write it out more

108
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:55,220
precisely: so if H t is not equal to H' r,
or Mt is not equal to M' r,

109
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:02,784
or the padding blocks are distinct, then
we have a collision for the compression

110
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:08,415
function h and we're done, we're done and we can stop.
So, the only way we need to continue is if

111
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:12,653
this three-way disjunction doesn't hold.
So what does it mean that this disjunction

112
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:16,998
doesn't hold? well, so the only reason we
need to continue is if the second-to-last

113
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:21,183
chaining variables are equal, the last
blocks of the messages are equal and the

114
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:25,605
two padding blocks are equal. So what does
it mean that the two padding blocks are

115
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,961
equal? Remember that the message lengths
were encoded in the padding block. So, in

116
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:34,371
particular, this means that the length of M
and the length of M' is the same,

117
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:38,782
namely the t is equal to r. So from now on
I can assume t is equal to r. Whenever I

118
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:43,972
wrote r, I'm just gonna write t. But now we
can apply exactly the same argument to the

119
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:48,773
second to last chaining variables. In
other words, how was H t computed? Well

120
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:53,703
H t is computed by hashing the previous
chaining variable, namely H t-1,

121
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:58,929
with the second to last message block. And
similarly, H' t was computed, you

122
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:05,128
notice I replaced r by t, so H' t was
computed by hashing the previous chaining

123
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:10,804
variable along with the second to last
message block of M'. And because

124
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:16,704
these two are equal, now we get another
candidate collision for the compression

125
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:23,030
function. In other words, if H t+1 is not
equal to H' t-1, or M t-1 is not equal to

126
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:29,985
M' t-1, then basically we
have a collision for h, and we can stop,

127
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:36,710
we're done. So now, the only case when we
need to continue is if this condition over

128
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:44,464
here doesn't hold, namely, so let's suppose
that H t-1 is equal to H' t-1

129
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:50,600
and we already know that, let's
see, so M t is equal to M' t and

130
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,060
M t-1 is equal to M' t-1.
Suppose it so happens that these two

131
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:02,010
conditions hold, well, you can see that now
we can continue to iterate. In other

132
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,750
words, we can now apply exactly the same
argument to H t-1 and H' t-1

133
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,566
and so iterating this again and
again, we can iterate all the way to the

134
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:17,450
beginning of the message. Iterate to the
beginning of the message, and one of two

135
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,252
things must hold, either we find the
collision for the compression function

136
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,262
or it so happens that all the message blocks
of M and M' are the same. In other

137
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:34,089
words, for all i, M i is equal to M' i.
But this means, because the messages, we'd

138
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:39,941
reprove the messages are the same length,
this means that M is actually equal to M'.

139
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:44,469
But then, this contradicts the fact
that you gave me a collision to begin

140
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:48,849
with, so, in other words, this condition
over here, can't actually happen because

141
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:53,342
it contradicts the fact that M and M'
are actually a collision for the big

142
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:58,059
Merkle-Damgard function H. And, as
a result, this means that we have to find a

143
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:02,664
collision for the compression function, so
that, as we work our way from the end of

144
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:07,269
the message, all the way to the beginning,
at some point we must find the collision

145
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:11,492
for little h. Okay, so this basically
completes the proof of the theorems, I can

146
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:15,738
put a little QED block here, so basically
what this proof is, that if the little

147
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:19,553
compression function h is collision
resistant, then the big Merkle-Damgard

148
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:24,013
function H must also be collision
resistant. So, again, the reason why people

149
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:28,366
like this construction is it shows that
to construct big hash functions,

150
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:32,611
it suffices to construct just compression
functions for small inputs, and we're

151
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,439
gonna do that in the next segment.
