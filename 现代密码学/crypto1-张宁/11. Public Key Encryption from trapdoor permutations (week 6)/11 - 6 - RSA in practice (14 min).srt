1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:04,510
To conclude this module I want to say a few words about how RSA is used in practice.

2
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,690
So first of all, if you want to speed up RSA encryption,

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,236
it's perfectly fine to use a small encryption exponent e.

4
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:17,178
So rather than using a random e one can use a small value of e

5
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:20,944
and in fact the minimum value that's possible is e=3.

6
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:24,446
So it's not difficult to see that the smallest possible value for e

7
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:27,608
is in fact e=3. And let's see why.

8
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:33,327
Well e=1 is a bad idea because that's not particularly hard to invert with e=1.

9
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:38,217
e=2 is not a valid RSA exponent because remember in the definition of RSA,

10
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:45,602
e had to be relatively prime to phi(N). phi(N), if you remember, is (p-1) times (q-1),

11
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:48,484
which is an even number. If p and q are odd primes,

12
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:53,292
(p-1) times (q-1) is an even number, but if e is even, if e is equal to two,

13
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:58,832
it's not going to be relatively prime to phi(N). So e=2 is not valid either.

14
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:02,007
And then e=3 is the first minimum value that can be used,

15
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:06,904
and then we just have to make sure that in fact, p is
equal to two mod three,

16
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:13,016
and q is equal to 2 mod 3 so that (p-1) times (q-1) is not divisible by 3.

17
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:16,545
So in fact this is a fine public exponent to use,

18
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:21,931
however the recommended value is 2 to the 16  plus 1. So 65537.

19
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,848
It's a good idea to use this recommended value of e.

20
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:29,601
To compute x^3 mod N, you would basically need three multiplications.

21
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:36,987
To compute x^65537 mod N using repeated squaring, you would need 17 multiplications.

22
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:41,111
Basically what you would do is you would repeatedly square 16 times

23
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,100
and then you would multiply by x one more time.

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,732
Ok? So just with 17 multiplications you can do this exponentiation,

25
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,867
so this is still much, much faster than using a random e,

26
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,735
which would require something like 2000 multiplications.

27
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:57,125
So this leads us into what's called the asymmetry of RSA,

28
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:01,773
where in fact encryption is quite fast: encryption only requires 17 multiplications.

29
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,107
However decryption is much, much, much slower;

30
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:07,452
it requires something on the order of 2,000 multiplications.

31
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:14,007
I should point out that there is a standard trick for slightly speeding up RSA decryption.

32
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:18,676
This is called RSA-CRT; this stands for RSA with Chinese remaindering.

33
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:22,775
It's a method for speeding up RSA decryption by about a factor of four,

34
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:26,514
but nevertheless it's still gonna be much, much, much slower than encryption.

35
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:31,484
The ratio of encryption to decryption on RSA is roughly a factor of ten to thirty,

36
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:36,793
so encryption could be up to like thirty times faster than decryption, depending on the size of your modulus.

37
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:42,173
Interestingly, this is a special property of RSA where encryption is so much faster than decryption.

38
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:47,108
And other public key systems--for example, in the
next module we're gonna look at ElGamal encryption--

39
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:52,056
don't have this property where both encryption and decryption take roughly the same amount of time.

40
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:57,730
We've already discussed key lengths for RSA before.

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,583
So I just wanted to flash these numbers to remind you that if you're using a 128-bit AES key,

42
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,334
really, you should be using a 3,000-bit modulus.

43
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:08,799
Although everybody just uses a 2,048 bit modulus.

44
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:15,433
And if you're really using a long AES key, like a 256 bit AES key, the RSA modulus gets to be quite big.

45
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:20,882
Now, I wanted to mention a number of implementation attacks on RSA.

46
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,648
These are attacks that have been demonstrated against particular,

47
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:28,715
mathematically correct implementations of RSA. However, these implementations were vulnerable

48
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:34,068
to certain side channel attacks that make the implementation completely insecure.

49
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:37,799
So the first example of this is due to Paul Kocher back in '97.

50
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,479
He showed a timing attack where all you do is you measure the time for an RSA decryption.

51
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,799
And simply by measuring the time, you can actually expose the secret exponent d.

52
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,168
And so, this says that if you are going to implement an RSA decryption,

53
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:55,736
you had better make sure that the decryption time is independent of the arguments.

54
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,593
Another attack also by Paul Kocher two years later showed that

55
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:04,166
if you have a smart card that's implementing RSA decryption

56
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:08,304
you can actually measure the power consumption of the card while it's doing RSA decryption

57
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:13,302
and then simply by looking at the peaks and troughs you can literally read off the bits of d

58
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:18,486
one bit at a time as the smart card is running through the repeated squaring algorithm.

59
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:23,040
So using a power analysis attack it's actually fairly easy to get the secret bits

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,038
of the secret key unless the smart card defends against power analysis attacks.

61
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:32,922
And finally another attack called a fault attack shows that the RSA is very vulnerable to

62
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:38,042
decryption errors and in particular, if for some reason an error occurs during an RSA decryption,

63
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:42,345
one error is actually completely enough to reveal the secret key.

64
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:47,098
So this attack is actually fairly significant. It's just, one error completely reveals your secret key.

65
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:51,811
And as a result, many cryptolibraries will actually check the result of the RSA decryption

66
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:55,451
before returning it to the caller. And the way you would check it is,

67
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:59,802
you would take the output of this exponentiation, and simply raise it to the power of e,

68
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:03,750
and check that you actually get back c modulo N.

69
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:07,466
And if so, you know that your decryption was done correctly.

70
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:11,706
Now the reason you can do this is because again, e is much smaller than d,

71
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:16,267
therefore checking takes much less time than actually raising something to the power of d.

72
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:21,156
Nevertheless, you know, even though checking is ten times faster than the actual decryption,

73
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:25,724
this still introduces a 10% slowdown. And so sometimes this is actually turned off.

74
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:30,505
But nevertheless, it's actually a good idea to check that your RSA output is correctly computed.

75
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:35,990
And so all these attacks kind of again make the point that if you just implement RSA naively

76
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,642
it would be mathematically correct, it would work,

77
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:41,948
however there would be all these potential attacks on the implementation

78
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:44,830
and as a result you should never implement RSA yourself.

79
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,910
Always, always use standard libraries and just use the implementation available there.

80
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,564
So to be concrete, I wanted to show you an example of one of these attacks.

81
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:58,080
And in particular I'll show you the fault attacks on RSA.

82
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,779
And again, this will be a fault attack on what's called RSA with Chinese remaindering.

83
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:07,182
So in fact, as I said at the beginning of the segment, RSA decryption is often implemented as follows:

84
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:14,416
What you do is, you decrypt the cipher text c modulo p, then you decrypt the cipher text c modulo q.

85
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,184
And then you combine the two to actually get the decryption modulo N.

86
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:21,306
And this combination is done using what's called a Chinese remainder theorem.

87
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:25,035
Which I'm not going to explain here but it's not too difficult to see how that works.

88
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:28,895
Basically, once you have the result of the decryption mod p and the decryption mod q

89
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:31,210
you can combine it to get the decryption mod N.

90
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,022
And it turns out this gives about a factor of four speed up

91
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:38,612
over the naive implementation of directly doing the exponential modulo N.

92
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,962
Okay. So, let's see why this is vulnerable to faults.

93
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:48,783
Suppose it so happens that when your decryption library is computing the decryption modulo q,

94
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,631
for some reason the processor makes an error.

95
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:57,403
And, actually, what it gets is not the correct xq. It gets an incorrect xq,

96
00:06:57,403 --> 00:07:01,817
so let's call this xq hat. However when it computed the decryption modulo p,

97
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:05,549
you know, no error occurred. So these errors are fairly infrequent.

98
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:09,952
And so let's just assume that an error occurred modulo one prime

99
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:13,706
but it did not occur modulo the other prime.

100
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:18,407
Well, if that's the case our computation is correct modulo p and incorrect modulo q.

101
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:22,608
That says when we combine the two results we're actually going to get an output,

102
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:27,044
I'll call it x prime, such that the output is correct modulo p.

103
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:31,507
So, x prime is really equal c to the d mod p but is incorrect modulo q.

104
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:37,040
If we raised both these equations to the power of e, what we obtain is the following two relations.

105
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,462
Well, let's see. This guy we raise it to power of e.

106
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:43,237
What happens is the left hand side becomes x prime to the e.

107
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,801
The right hand side, here, it's c to the d.

108
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:50,194
If I raise c to the d to the power of e--e and d, remember are inverses of one another--

109
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:56,177
And as a result, if I raise c to the d to the power of e, both exponents cancel out and I simply get c back.

110
00:07:56,177 --> 00:08:00,912
So I know that x prime to the e is equal to c. But modulo q, there was a mistake.

111
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:04,400
So x prime to the e is not equal to c modulo q.

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,711
So therefore, if I look at this difference, x prime to the e minus c.

113
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:13,392
We know that it's zero modulo p, and it's not zero modulo q.

114
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:17,108
So now if we compute the GCD of this value with N, what do we get?

115
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,975
Well, as I said, this is zero mod p, but it's not equal to zero mod q.

116
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:30,839
Which means that this quantity here is divisible by p, but is not divisible by q.

117
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,333
So therefore when I compute the GCD, what I'll get is simply p.

118
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:41,102
And again, this is because p divides this quantity here when q does not divide this quantity.

119
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:45,262
So now basically what I have just obtained is the factorization of N.

120
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:48,946
Once I have the factorization of N I can compute phi(N)

121
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:55,623
and then given phi(N) I can actually compute myself the decryption exponent from the public key.

122
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:58,276
So now I have just recovered the secret key from the public key

123
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:02,634
from a single mistake that happened during decryption. So this is why typically

124
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:05,637
when you do RSA decryption it's a good idea to check the results

125
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:09,728
especially when you use Chinese remaindering to speed up RSA decryption.

126
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:14,040
The last attack I want to talk about is a very recent observation

127
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,169
that was observed by Heninger et al and Lenstra et al

128
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:22,571
that shows that RSA key generation can be problematic when it's done with bad entropy.

129
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:27,968
So here's how things go wrong. So the way open SSL generates RSA keys is as follows.

130
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:32,440
Well, it starts by basically seeding the pseudo random number generator.

131
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,090
And then it uses random bits from a pseudo random number generator to generate the first prime p.

132
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,642
Then it will go ahead and seed the random number generator some more,

133
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:45,784
and will generate bits from the pseudo random number generator to generate q.

134
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,745
And finally, it will output the product of p and q.

135
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:53,680
Okay so the two steps, where we see the seed the pseudo random number generator.

136
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,652
Now suppose that this is implemented on a router or a firewall of some sort,

137
00:09:57,652 --> 00:10:02,299
and suppose that the key generation happens right after the firewall starts up.

138
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:06,250
So the firewall boots up. At the time of the boot, there's not a lot of entropy

139
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,901
in the pseudo random number generator, and as a result

140
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,613
the firewall is likely to generate a prime p that comes from a very low entropy pool.

141
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:19,004
Which means that this p is gonna be one of a small number of possibilities.

142
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:23,774
However, after we've generated p, generating the prime actually takes a little bit of time,

143
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:28,142
a few microseconds. And so, by then the firewall will have generated more entropy

144
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:31,670
and so after we add more entropy to the entropy pool,

145
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:38,672
the prime q say is generated from a much larger entropy pool and is therefore unique to this firewall.

146
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:44,811
Now the problem is that many different firewalls if they generate an RSA key

147
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:51,247
in this way many of them will actually end up using the same prime p but a different prime q.

148
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:57,812
So what this says is that if we look at two RSA moduli from two different firewalls, N1 and N2.

149
00:10:57,812 --> 00:11:04,116
If we compute the GCD of N1 and N2, well both of them had different q's but the same p.

150
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:08,648
So if we compute the GCD, actually we will end up with a factorization of N,

151
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:14,482
of both N1 and N2 and then we can actually figure out the private key both for N1 and for N2.

152
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:16,706
So this has actually been observed in practice.

153
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:19,792
Both of these groups, what they did is they scanned the web

154
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:24,821
and recovered all of the public keys out there that are used on various web servers.

155
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:29,069
They then ran a massive GCD, using some arithmetic tricks

156
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:34,551
they were able to compute this massive GCD of all pairs of public keys N1 and N2.

157
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:39,826
And lo and behold, they actually realized that a fair number of these keys have a common factor.

158
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:42,472
So they were actually able to factor these moduli.

159
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:48,578
So in the experiment, they were actually able to factor about .4% of all public SSL keys.

160
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:54,247
This is an amazing fact, that, in fact, so many web server public keys out there

161
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:59,367
are vulnerable just because they happened to generate the RSA key using low entropy.

162
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,434
So they have a common factor with somebody
else's factor

163
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:05,987
and GCDing the two together gives you the factorization.

164
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:09,200
So, the lesson from all this is when you generate keys,

165
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,535
no matter whether they are RSA keys or ElGamal keys or symmetric keys,

166
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:17,985
it's crucial that the number--, that your generator is properly seeded.

167
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:23,019
So don't generate keys immediately after start up. You have to kind of make sure

168
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,155
the seeding of the generator has had enough time to actually generate enough entropy.

169
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:30,838
And only then you can start generating keys. So this is a really nice example

170
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:35,707
of how a, a bad random number generator can mess up your RSA public keys.

171
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:40,316
Okay so this is the end of our discussion of public encryption from RSA.

172
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:44,535
I wanted to mention a few further readings if you want to read more about this.

173
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:48,033
So there's a nice paper by Victor Shoup that talks about why

174
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,318
chosen cipher text security is so important in the public key settings.

175
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:56,737
So if the Bleichenbacher attack wasn't convincing enough, there are many other attacks like this

176
00:12:56,737 --> 00:13:00,172
that are possible if you don't use a chosen cipher-text secure system.

177
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:03,105
So if you want to learn more about chosen cipher-text security,

178
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,689
please look at Victor Shoup's paper.

179
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:11,439
There's a survey that I guess I wrote a couple years ago, that looks at many different attacks

180
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:14,772
on the RSA system. I guess I wrote this when RSA was twenty,

181
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:19,257
I actually need to update this to 30 years of attack on the RSA cryptosystem.

182
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:23,124
There've been some developments in the last decade, but for now this is actually a decent survey

183
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:26,760
to look at and read about more attacks on RSA.

184
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,800
The OAEP results that I mentioned are referenced here, OAEP reconsidered.

185
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,306
And finally, if you're interested in key length analysis of RSA and other public key systems,

186
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:40,555
there's a nice paper by Arjen Lenstra that discusses how you should choose

187
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:44,377
key lengths for your public key systems, and even for your symmetric key systems.

188
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:47,739
Okay, so those are the four references. I hope you have time to look through them.

189
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,596
And I will stop here. And, in the next module we're going to look at

190
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,596
another family of public key encryption systems, this time based on discrete log.
