1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
In this segment, we're gonna continue with
a few more tools from discrete

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,468
probability, and I want to remind everyone
that if you wanna read more about this,

3
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:11,521
there's more information in wiki books
article that is linked over here. So first

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:16,446
let's do a quick recap of where we are. We
said that the discrete probability is

5
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:21,496
always defined over a finite set, which
we're gonna denote by U, and typically for

6
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:26,671
us, U is going to be the set of all N bit
binary strings, which we denote by zero

7
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:31,534
130 N. Now a probability distribution P
over this universe U is basically a

8
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:36,834
function that assigns to every element in
the universe a weight in the interval zero

9
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:42,196
to one, such that if we sum the weight of
all these elements, the sum basically sums

10
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:47,210
up to one. Now we have said that subset of
the universe is what called an event, and

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,021
we said that probability of an event is
basically the sum of all the weights of

12
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:57,073
all the elements in the event and we said
that probability of an event is some real

13
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:01,764
numbers in the interval zero to one And I
would remind everyone the basically

14
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:06,575
probability of the entire universe is
basically the one by the fact that sum of

15
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:11,268
all the weights sums up to one. Then we
define what a random variable is Formally,

16
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:15,908
a random variable is a, is a function from
the universe of some other sets But the

17
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:20,773
thing that I want you to remember is that
the random variable takes, values in some

18
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:25,289
set v And, in fact, the random variable
defines the distribution on this set v. So

19
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:29,651
the next concept we need is what's called
independence And I'm gonna very briefly

20
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:34,278
define this If you want to read more about
independence, please go ahead and look at

21
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:38,374
the wiki books article. But essentially we
say that two events A and B are

22
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:42,932
independent of one another if When you
know that event A happens, that tells you

23
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:47,377
nothing about whether event B actually
happened or not. Formally, the way we

24
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:52,236
define independence is to say that, the
probability of A and B, namely, that both

25
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:56,621
events happened, is actually=to the
probability of event A the probability of

26
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,539
event B So mult iplication, in some sense,
the fact that probabilities multiply under

27
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,339
conjunction, captures the fact that these
events are independent And as I said, if

28
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:11,080
you wanna read more about that, please
take a look at the background material.

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,636
Now the same thing can be said for random
variables. So suppose we have two random

30
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:21,921
variables x and y. They take values in
some set v. Then we say that these random

31
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:26,868
variables are independent if the
probability that x = a, and y = b is equal

32
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:32,492
to the product of these two probabilities.
Basically what this means is, even if you

33
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:37,606
know that x = a, that tells you nothing
about the value of y. Okay, that, that's

34
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:43,060
what this multiplication means And again
this needs to hold for all A and B in the

35
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,185
space of values of these random variables
So, just again to job your memory If

36
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:53,112
you've seen this before, a very quick
example. Suppose we look at the, set of,

37
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:58,171
of two bit strings So, zero, zero, zero,
one, one zero and, one, one And suppose we

38
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:03,625
choose a random, from this set. Okay so we
randomly choose one of these four elements

39
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:08,431
with equal probability. Now let's define
two random variables. X is gonna be the

40
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:13,541
least significant bit that was generated,
and Y is gonna be the most significant bit

41
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,981
generated. So I claim that, these random
variables, x and y, are independent of one

42
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:23,880
another. And the way to see that
intuitively, is to realize that choosing r

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,440
uniformly, from the set of four elements
is basically the same as flipping a coin

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,051
An unbiased coin twice. The first bit
corresponds to the outcome of the first

45
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,517
flip and the second bit corresponds to the
outcome of the second flip And of course

46
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:43,197
there are four possible outcomes. All four
outcomes are equally likely which is why

47
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:47,821
we get the uniform distributions over two
bit strings Now our variables X and Y. Y

48
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:52,557
the independents Basically if I tell you
result of the first flip namely I tell you

49
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:57,181
the lest signify bit of R So I tell you
how the first coin you know whether it

50
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:01,804
fell on its head or fell on its tails.
That tells you nothing about the result of

51
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:06,844
the second flip. Which is why intuitively,
you might, you might expect these random

52
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:11,624
variables to be independent of one
another. But formally, we would have to

53
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:16,142
prove that, for, all 01 pairs, the
probability of, x=0 and y=0, x=1, y=1, and

54
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:21,446
so on. These probabilities multiply. Let's
just do it for one of these pairs. So

55
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:26,721
let's look at the probability that x is =
to zero, and y is = to zero. Well, you see

56
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:31,027
that the probability that x is equal to
zero and y is equal to zero is basically

57
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:35,387
the probability that r is equal to zero,
zero And what's the probability that r is

58
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:39,535
equal to zero, zero? Well, by the uniform
distribution, that's basically equal to

59
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:44,327
one-fourth. What it's one over side of the
set which is one fourth in this case And

60
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:49,095
well low and behold that's in fact these
probably provability multiply Because

61
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:53,583
again the probability that X is equal to
zero. The probability that lest signify

62
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:57,566
bit of R is equal to zero. This
provability is exactly one half because

63
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:01,941
there is exactly two elements that have
their, lest signify bit equals to zero.

64
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:06,373
Two out of four elements gives you a
provability of one half And similarly the

65
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,738
probability that Y is equal to zero is
also one half so in fact the provability

66
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:16,434
multiplies. Okay, so that's, this concept
of independence And the reason I wanted to

67
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:21,892
show you that is because we're gonna look
at an, an important property of XOR that

68
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:27,349
we're gonna use again and again. So before
we talk about XOR, let me just do a very

69
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:32,408
quick review of what XOR is. So, of
course, XOR of two bits means the addition

70
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:38,065
of those bits, modular two. So just too
kind of, make sure everybody's on the same

71
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:43,233
page If we have two bits, so 0001, ten and
eleven. Their XOR or the truth table of

72
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:48,106
the XOR is basically just the addition
modular two. As you can see, one+1 is= to

73
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:52,978
two, modular two. That's=to zero. So this
is the truth table for [inaudible] XOR And

74
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,665
I'm always going to denote XOR by the
circle with a + inside And then when I

75
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:02,353
wanna apply XOR to bit strings, I apply
the, addition modular two operation,

76
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:07,472
bitwise. So, for example, the XOR of these
two strings would be, 110, and I guess

77
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:12,283
I'll let you fill out the rest of the
XORs, just to make sure we're all on the

78
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:18,941
same page. So of course is comes out to
one, one zero one. Now, we're gonna be

79
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:23,092
doing a lot of XORing in this class. In
fact, there's a classical joke that the

80
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:27,669
only think cryptographers know how to do
is just XOR things together But I want to

81
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,607
explain to you why we see XOR so
frequently in cryptography. Basically, XOR

82
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,865
has a very important property, and the
property is the following. Suppose we have

83
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:40,630
a random variable y. That's distributed
arbitrarily over 01 to the n. So we know

84
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,773
nothing about the distribution of y But
now, suppose we have an independent random

85
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:50,790
variable that happens to be uniformly
distributed also over 01 to the n. So it's

86
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,766
very important that x is uniform. N's
independent of y. So now let's define the

87
00:06:55,766 --> 00:07:00,851
random variable which is the XOR of x and
y. Then I claim that no matter what

88
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:05,937
distribution y started with, this z is
always going to be a uniform, random

89
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:11,287
variable. So in other words if I take an
arbitrarily malicious distribution and I

90
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:16,373
XOR with independent uniform random
variable what I end up with is a uniform

91
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:20,672
random variable. Okay and this again is
kind of a key property that makes x or

92
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,490
very useful for crypto. So this is
actually a very simple factor to prove,

93
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,851
let's just go ahead and do it, let's just
prove it for one bit so for n = one. Okay,

94
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:33,472
so the way we'll do it is we'll basically
write out the probability distributions

95
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:38,242
for the various random variables. So let's
see, for the random variable y. Well, the

96
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:43,167
random variable can be either zero or one.
And let's say that P0 is the probability

97
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:47,320
that it's = to zero, and P1 is the
probability that it's =to one. Okay, so

98
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,008
that's one of our tables. Similarly, we're
gonna have a table for the variable x.

99
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:56,458
Well, the variable x is much easier.
That's a uniform random variable. So the

100
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,909
probability that it's=to zero is exactly
one half The probability that's it's=to

101
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,428
one is also exactly one half. Now, let's
write out the probabilities for the join

102
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,599
di stribution. In, in other words, let's
see what the probability, is for the

103
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,099
various, joint values of y and x. In other
words, how likely is, it that y is zero,

104
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,435
and x is zero. Y is zero, and x is one. Y
is one and x is zero, and eleven. Well, so

105
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:22,770
what we do is, basically, because we
assume the variables are independent, all

106
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,518
we have to do is multiply the
probabilities. So The probability that y

107
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:30,552
is equal to zero is p zero. Probability
that x is equal to zero is one-half. So

108
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:36,843
the proximity that, we get 00 as exactly p
zero over two. Similarly for zero one

109
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:42,387
we'll get p zero over two, for one zero
we'll get p one over two And for 1-1,

110
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:47,232
again, the probability that y is=to one,
and x is=to one, Well, that's P1  the

111
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:52,347
probability that x is=to one, which is a
half, so it's P1 over two. Okay? So those

112
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:57,664
are the four, probabilities for the
various options for x and y. So now, let's

113
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:03,182
analyze, what is the probability that z is
equal to zero? Well, the probability that

114
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:08,768
z is=to zero is basically the same as the
probability that, let's write it this way,

115
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:15,342
xy. Is=to 00. Or xy is=to, eleven. Those
are the two possible cases that z is=to

116
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:22,652
zero Because z is the XOR of x and y. Now,
these events are disjoint, so, this

117
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:30,336
expression can simply be written as the
sum of the two expressions given above. So

118
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:37,271
basically, it's the probability that xy
is=to 00, plus the probability that xy,

119
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:43,281
is=to eleven. So now we can simply look up
these probabilities in our table. So the

120
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:47,874
probability that xy is equal to 00 is
simply p zero over two, and the

121
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:53,156
probability that xy is equal to one, one
is simply p one over two. So we get P0

122
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:58,818
over two +P1 over two But what do we kn-,
what do we know about P0 and P1? Well,

123
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:03,819
it's a probability distribution.
Therefore, P0+P1 must =one And therefore,

124
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:09,482
this fraction here must= to a half. P0+P1
is =to one. So therefore, the sum of these

125
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:15,292
two terms must = a half And we're done.
Basically, we proved that the probability

126
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:20,143
that z is = to zero. Is one half,
therefore the probability that z is equal

127
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:25,123
to one is also one half. Therefore z is a
unif orm random variable. So the simple

128
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:29,773
theorem is the main reason why x o is so
useful in cartography. The last thing I

129
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:34,437
wanna show you about discreet probability
is what's called the birthday paradox And

130
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:38,934
I'm gonna do it really fast here Because
we're gonna come back later on, and talk

131
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:42,931
about this in more detail. So, the
birthday paradox says the following

132
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:47,370
suppose I choose n random variables in our
universe u. Okay And it just so happens

133
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,485
that these variables are independent of
one another. They actually don't have to

134
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,651
be uniform. All we need to assume is that
they're distributed in the same way. The

135
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:59,818
most important property though is that
they're independent of one another. So the

136
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:04,035
theorem says that if you choose roughly
the square root of the size of u elements,

137
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:08,202
we're kind of this one point two here, it
doesn't really matter. But if you choose

138
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:12,471
square root of the size of u elements,
then basically there's a good chance that

139
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,740
there are two elements that are the same.
In other words, if you sample about square

140
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,158
root a few times, then it's likely that
two of your samples. [inaudible] will be

141
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:25,763
equal to each other. And by the way, I
should point out that this inverted e,

142
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:30,860
just means exists. So there exists in
[inaudible] I and j such that r I is equal

143
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,057
to r j. So here's a concrete example.
We'll actually see many, many times.

144
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:39,493
Suppose our universe consist of all
strings of length of one hundred and

145
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:44,279
twenty eight bits. So the size of you is
gigantic it's actually two to the hundred

146
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,123
and twenty eight. It's a very, very large
set But it so happens if you sample say

147
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:53,909
around two the sixty four times from the
set. This is about the square root of U

148
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:58,520
then is very likely that two of your
sample messages will actually be the same.

149
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,871
So why is, this called the paradox? Well,
traditionally it's described in terms of

150
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:06,896
people's birthdays. So you would think
that each of these samples would be

151
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:11,772
someone's birthday And so the question is
how many people need to get together so

152
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,510
that there are two people that have the
same birthday? So, just as a simple cal

153
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,349
culation you can see there are 365 days in
the year, so you would need about 1.2

154
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:26,656
times the square root of 365 people until
the probability that two of them have the

155
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:31,327
same birthday is more than a half. This if
I'm not mistaken is about 24, which means

156
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:35,673
that if 24 random people get together in a
room it's very likely that two of them

157
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:40,020
will actually have the same birthday. This
is why it's called a paradox, because 24

158
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,457
supposedly is a smaller number than you
would expect. Interestingly, people's

159
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:50,401
birthdays are not actually uniform across
all 365 days of the year. There's actually

160
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:55,223
a bias towards December. >> But, I guess
that's not, that's not relative to the

161
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:59,878
discussion here. >> The last thing I
wanted to do is just show you the birthday

162
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:04,533
paradox a bit more concretely. So, suppose
we have a universe of about a million

163
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,244
samples, then you can see that when we
sample roughly 1200 times, the probability

164
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,197
that we get, we sample the same number,
the same element twice is roughly half But

165
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:18,498
the probability of sampling the same
number twice actually converges very

166
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:22,857
quickly to one. You can see that if we
about 2200 items, then the probability

167
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:26,790
that two of those items are the same,
already is 90 percent and You know, 3000

168
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,440
then it's basically one. So this
conversion is very quickly to one as soon

169
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,484
as he goes beyond the square root of the
size of the universe. So we're gonna come

170
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:38,380
back and study the birthday paradox in
more detail later on, but I just for now,

171
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,597
wanted you to know what it is. So that's
the end of this segment, and then in the

172
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:49,509
next segment we'll start with our first
example of encryption systems. [sound]
