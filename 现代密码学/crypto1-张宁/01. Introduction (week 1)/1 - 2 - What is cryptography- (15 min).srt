1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,951
Before we start with the technical
material, I wanna give you a quick

2
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:06,487
overview of what cryptography is about and
the different areas of cryptography. So

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:10,487
the core of cryptography of course is
secure communication that essentially

4
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:14,539
consists of two parts. The first is
secured key establishment and then how do

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,697
we communicate securely once we have a
shared key. We already said that secured

6
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:22,854
key establishment essentially amounts to
Alice and Bob sending messages to one

7
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:26,906
another such that at the end of this
protocol, there's a shared key that they

8
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:30,906
both agree on, shared key K, and beyond
that, beyond just a shared key, in fact

9
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:35,274
Alice would know that she's talking to Bob
and Bob would know that he's talking to

10
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:39,964
Alice. But a poor attacker who listens in
on this conversation has no idea what the

11
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:44,011
shared key is. And we'll see how to do
that later on in the course. Now once they

12
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:47,657
have a shared key, they want exchange
messages securely using this key, and

13
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:51,698
we'll talk about encryption schemes that
allow them to do that in such a way that

14
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:55,491
an attacker can't figure out what messages
are being sent back and forth. And

15
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:59,630
furthermore an attacker cannot even tamper
with this traffic without being detected.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,227
In other words, these encryption schemes
provide both confidentiality and

17
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:06,774
integrity. But cryptography does much,
much, much more than just these two

18
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:10,519
things. And I want to give you a few
examples of that. So the first example I

19
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,468
want to give you is what's called a
digital signature. So a digital signature,

20
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:18,892
basically, is the analog of the signature
in the physical world. In the physical

21
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:23,372
world, remember when you sign a document,
essentially, you write your signature on

22
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:27,740
that document and your signature is always
the same. You always write the same

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,164
signature on all documents that you wanna
sign. In the digital world, this can't

24
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:36,812
possibly work because if the attacker just
obtained one signed document from me, he

25
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:41,180
can cut and paste my signature unto some
other document that I might not have

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,247
wanted to sign. And so, it's simply not
possible in a digital world that my

27
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:49,590
signature is the same for all documents
that I want to sign. So we're gonna talk

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,830
about how to construct digital signatures
in the second half of the course. It's

29
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,123
really quite an interesting primitive and
we'll see exactly how to do it. Just to

30
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:02,098
give you a hint, the way digital
signatures work is basically by making the

31
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:06,232
digital signature via function of the
content being signed. So an attacker who

32
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:10,313
tries to copy my signature from one
document to another is not gonna succeed

33
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:14,541
because the signature. On the new document
is not gonna be the proper function of the

34
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,526
data in the new document, and as a result,
the signature won't verify. And as I said,

35
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:22,608
we're gonna see exactly how to construct
digital signatures later on and then we'll

36
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:27,193
prove that those constructions are secure.
Another application of cryptography that I

37
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:31,096
wanted to mention, is anonymous
communication. So, here, imagine user

38
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:35,828
Alice wants to talk to some chat server,
Bob. And, perhaps she wants to talk about

39
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:40,382
a medical condition, and so she wants to
do that anonymously, so that the chat

40
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:45,113
server doesn't actually know who she is.
Well, there's a standard method, called a

41
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:49,946
mixnet, that allows Alice to communicate
over the public internet with Bob through

42
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:54,856
a sequence of proxies such that at the end
of the communication Bob has no idea who he

43
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:59,537
just talked to. The way mixnets work
is basically as Alice sends her messages

44
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:03,818
to Bob through a sequence of proxies,
these messages get encrypted and

45
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,271
decrypted appropriately so that Bob has no
idea who he talked to and the proxies

46
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,724
themselves don't even know that Alice is
talking to Bob, or that actually who is

47
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:16,750
talking to whom more generally. One
interesting thing about this anonymous

48
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,498
communication channel is, this is
bi-directional. In other words, even

49
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:24,743
though Bob has no idea who he's talking
to, he can still respond to Alice and

50
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:29,153
Alice will get those messages. Once we
have anonymous communication, we can build

51
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:33,784
other privacy mechanisms. And I wanna give
you one example which is called anonymous

52
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:37,643
digital cash. Remember that in the
physical world if I have a physical

53
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:42,108
dollar, I can walk into a bookstore and
buy a book and the merchant would have no

54
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:46,876
idea who I am. The question is whether we
can do the exact same thing in the digital

55
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:50,963
world. In the digital world, basically,
Alice might have a digital dollar,

56
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:55,984
a digital dollar coin. And she might wanna
spend that digital dollar at some online

57
00:03:55,984 --> 00:04:00,760
merchants, perhaps some online bookstore.
Now, what we'd like to do is make it so

58
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,539
that when Alice spends her coin at the
bookstore, the bookstore would have no

59
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,629
idea who Alice is. So we provide the same
anonymity that we get from physical cash.

60
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:15,470
Now the problem is that in the digital
world, Alice can take the coin that she

61
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,250
had, this one dollar coin, and before she spent
it, she can actually make copies of it.

62
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,086
And then all of a sudden instead of just
having just one dollar coin now all

63
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:27,936
of a sudden she has three dollar coins and
they're all the same of course, and

64
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:31,828
there's nothing preventing her from taking
those replicas of a dollar coin and

65
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:35,819
spending it at other merchants. And so the
question is how do we provide anonymous

66
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,849
digital cash? But at the same time, also
prevent Alice from double spending the

67
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:43,760
dollar coin at different merchants. In
some sense there's a paradox here where

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,879
anonymity is in conflict with security
because if we have anonymous cash there's

69
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,999
nothing to prevent Alice from double
spending the coin and because the coin is

70
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,244
anonymous we have no way of telling who
committed this fraud. And so the question

71
00:04:56,244 --> 00:05:00,394
is how do we resolve this tension. And it
turns out, it's completely doable. And

72
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:04,757
we'll talk about anonymous digital cash
later on. Just to give you a hint, I'll

73
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:09,173
say that the way we do it is basically by
making sure that if Alice spends the coin

74
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:13,764
once then no one knows who she is, but if
she spends the coin more than once, all of

75
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:17,878
a sudden, her identity is completely
exposed and then she could be subject to

76
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:22,096
all sorts of legal problems. And so that's
how anonymous digital cash would

77
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:26,158
work at a high level and we'll see how to
implement it later on in the course.

78
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:30,219
Another application of cryptography has to
do with more abstract protocols, but

79
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:34,333
before I speak the general result, I
want to give you two examples. So the

80
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,343
first example has to do with election
systems. So here's the election problem.

81
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:42,656
Suppose ... we have two parties, party zero
and party one. And voters vote for these

82
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:47,101
parties. So for example, this voter could
have voted for party zero, this voter voted for

83
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:52,313
party one. And so on. So in this election,
party zero got three votes and party two

84
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:56,590
got two votes. So the winner of the
election, of course, is party zero. But

85
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,579
more generally, the winner of the election
is the party who receives the majority of

86
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:06,453
the votes. Now, the voting problem is the
following. The voters would somehow like

87
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:11,720
to compute the majority of the votes, but
do it in such a way such that nothing else

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,797
is revealed about their individual votes.
Okay? So the question is how to do that?

89
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:21,493
And to do so, we're gonna introduce an
election center who's gonna help us

90
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:26,633
compute the majority, but keep the votes
otherwise secret. And what the parties

91
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:32,027
will do is they will each send the funny
encryption of their votes to the election

92
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:36,949
center in such a way that at the end of
the election, the election center is able

93
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,615
to compute and output the winner of the
election. However, other than the winner

94
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:46,580
of the election, nothing else is revealed
about the individual votes. The individual

95
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,366
votes otherwise remain completely private.
Of course the election center is also

96
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:56,331
gonna verify that this voter for example
is allowed to vote and that the voter has

97
00:06:56,331 --> 00:07:00,818
only voted once. But other than that
information the election center and the

98
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:05,484
rest of the world learned nothing else
about that voter's vote other than the

99
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:10,104
result of the election. So this is an
example of a protocol that involves six

100
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:14,430
parties. In this case, there are five
voters in one election center. These

101
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,417
parties compute amongst themselves. And at
the end of the computation, the result of

102
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:24,404
the election is known but nothing else is
revealed about the individual inputs. Now

103
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:29,156
a similar problem comes up in the context
of private auctions. So in a private

104
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:34,160
auction every bidder has his own bid that
he wants to bid. And now suppose the

105
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,356
auction mechanism that's being used is
what's called a Vickrey auction where the

106
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:45,287
definition of a Vickrey auction is that
the winner is the highest bidder. But the

107
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:50,099
amounts that the winner pays is actually
the second highest bid. So he pays the

108
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,850
second highest bid. Okay, so this is a
standard auction mechanism called the

109
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,028
Vickrey auction. And now what we'd like to
do is basically enable the participants to

110
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:04,779
compute, to figure out who the highest
bidder is and how much he's supposed to

111
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,165
pay, but other than that, all other
information about the individual bids

112
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:14,160
should remain secret. So for example, the
actual amount that the highest bidder bid

113
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,225
should remain secret. The only thing that
should become public is the second highest

114
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:23,526
bid and the identity of the highest
bidder. So again now, the way we will do

115
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:28,172
that is we'll introduce an auction center, and
in a similar way, essentially, everybody

116
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:32,588
will send their encrypted bids to the
auction center. The auction center will

117
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:37,119
compute the identity of the winner and in
fact he will also compute the second

118
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,822
highest bid but other than these two
values, nothing else is revealed about the

119
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:46,126
individual bids. Now, this is actually an
example of a much more general problem

120
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,264
called secure multi-party computation. Let
me explain what secure multi-party

121
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:54,618
computation is about. So here, basically
abstractly, the participants have a secret

122
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,649
inputs to themselves. So, in the case of
an election, the inputs would be the

123
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,787
votes. In the case of an auction, the
inputs would be the secret bids. And then

124
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:06,959
what they would like to do is compute some
sort of a function of their inputs.

125
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,840
Again, in the case of an election, the
function's a majority. In the case of

126
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,088
auction, the function happens to be the
second highest, largest number among x one

127
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:19,179
to x four. And the question is, how can
they do that, such that the value of the

128
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,375
function is revealed, but nothing else is
revealed about the individual votes? So

129
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,675
let me show you kind of a dumb, insecure
way of doing it. What we do is introduce a

130
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:31,774
trusted party. And then, this trusted
authority basically collects individual

131
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:36,223
inputs. And it kinda promises to keep the
individual inputs secret, so that only it

132
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:40,510
would know what they are. And then, it
publishes the value of the function, to

133
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,742
the world. So, the idea is now that the
value of the function became public, but

134
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:48,812
nothing else is revealed about the
individual inputs. But, of course, you got

135
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:52,990
this trusted authority that you got to
trust, and if for some reason it's not

136
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,168
trustworthy, then you have a problem. And
so, there's a very central theorem in

137
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:01,001
crypto and it really is quite a
surprising fact. That says that any

138
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,204
computation you'd like to do, any function
F you'd like to compute, that you can

139
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,302
compute with a trusted authority, you can
also do without a trusted authority.

140
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:13,559
Let me at a high level explain what this
means. Basically, what we're gonna do, is

141
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,816
we're gonna get rid of the authority. So
the parties are actually not gonna send

142
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:21,807
their inputs to the authority. And, in
fact, there's no longer going to be an

143
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:26,011
authority in the system. Instead, what the
parties are gonna do, is they're gonna

144
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:30,567
talk to one another using some protocol.
Such that at the end of the protocol all

145
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:34,890
of a sudden the value of the function
becomes known to everybody. And yet

146
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,390
nothing other than the value of the
function is revealed. In other words, the

147
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,639
individual inputs is still kept secret.
But again there's no authority, there's

148
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,867
just a way for them to talk to one another
such that the final output is revealed. So

149
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:51,846
this is a fairly general result, it's kind
of a surprising fact that is at all

150
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:56,024
doable. And in fact it is and towards the
end of the class we'll actually see how to

151
00:10:56,024 --> 00:11:00,577
make this happen. Now, there are some
applications of cryptography that I can't

152
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,560
classify any other way other than to say
that they are purely magical. Let me give

153
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,240
you two examples of that. So the first is
what's called privately outsourcing

154
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,224
computation. So I'll give you an example
of a Google search just to illustrate the

155
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:20,329
point. So imagine Alice has a search query
that she wants to issue. It turns out that

156
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:25,434
there are very special encryption schemes
such that Alice can send an encryption of

157
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,368
her query to Google. And then because of
the property of the encryption scheme

158
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:35,304
Google can actually compute on the
encrypted values without knowing what the

159
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:40,368
plain texts are. So Google can actually
run its massive search algorithm on the

160
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:44,903
encrypted query and recover in encrypted
results. Okay. Google will send the

161
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:49,242
encrypted results back to Alice. Alice
will decrypt and then she will receive the

162
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:53,689
results. But the magic here is all Google
saw was just encryptions of her queries

163
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:57,493
and nothing else. And so, Google as a
result has no idea what Alice just

164
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:01,672
searched for and nevertheless Alice
actually learned exactly what she

165
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:05,812
wanted to learn. Okay so, these are
magical kind of encryption schemes. They're

166
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:09,985
fairly recent, this is only a new
development from about two or three years

167
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:14,436
ago, that allows us to compute on encrypted
data, even though we don't really know

168
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:18,667
what's inside the encryption. Now, before
you rush off and think about implementing

169
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,470
this, I should warn you that this is
really at this point just theoretical, in

170
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,422
the sense that running a Google search on
encryption data probably would take a

171
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:30,521
billion years. But nevertheless, just the
fact that this is doable is already really

172
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,473
surprising, and is already quite useful
for relatively simple computations. So in

173
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:38,671
fact, we'll see some applications of this
later on. The other magical application I

174
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:42,474
want to show you is what's called zero
knowledge. And in particular, I'll tell

175
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:46,080
you about something called the zero
knowledge proof of knowledge. So here ...

176
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,177
what happens is there's a certain
number N, which Alice knows. And the way

177
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:54,169
the number N was constructed is as a
product of two large primes. So, imagine

178
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,835
here we have two primes, P and Q. Each one
you can think of it as like 1000 digits.

179
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:03,892
And you probably know that multiplying
two 1000-digit numbers is fairly easy. But if

180
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:08,235
I just give you their product, figuring
out their factorization into primes is

181
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:12,427
actually quite difficult. And, in fact,
we're gonna use the fact that factoring is

182
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:16,566
difficult to build public key cryptosystems
in the second half of the course.

183
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:20,968
Okay, so Alice happens to have this number
N, and she also knows the factorization of

184
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,898
N. Now Bob just has the number N. He
doesn't actually know the factorization.

185
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:28,723
Now, the magical fact about the zero
knowledge proof of knowledge, is that

186
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:33,144
Alice can prove to Bob that she knows the
factorization of N. Yes, you can actually

187
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:37,457
give this proof to Bob, that Bob can
check, and become convinced that Alice

188
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:42,386
knows the factorization of N, however Bob
learns nothing at all. About the factors P

189
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:47,034
and Q, and this is provable. Bob
absolutely learns nothing at all about the

190
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,997
factors P and Q. And the statement
actually is very, very general. This is

191
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:55,275
not just about proving the factorization
of N. In fact, almost any puzzle that you

192
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:59,606
want to prove that you know an answer to,
you can prove it is your knowledge. So if

193
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,831
you have a crossword puzzle that you've
solved. Well, maybe crosswords is not the

194
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:07,845
best example. But if you have like a
Sudoku puzzle, for example, that you want

195
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:12,282
to prove that you've solved, you can prove
it to Bob in a way that Bob would learn

196
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:16,718
nothing at all about the solution, and yet
Bob would be convinced that you really do

197
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:20,930
have a solution to this puzzle. Okay. So
those are kind of magical applications.

198
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,000
And so the last thing I want to say is
that modern cryptography is a very

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,015
rigorous science. And in fact, every
concept we're gonna describe is gonna

200
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:33,129
follow three very rigorous steps, okay,
and we're gonna see these three steps

201
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:37,338
again and again and again so I wanna
explain what they are. So the first thing

202
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:41,493
we're gonna do when we introduce a new
primitive like a digital signature is

203
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:45,540
we're gonna specify precisely what the
threat model is. That is, what can an

204
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,534
attacker do to attack a digital signature
and what is his goal in forging

205
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:53,851
signatures? Okay, so we're gonna define
exactly what does it mean for a signature

206
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,760
for example to be unforgeable.
Unforgeable. Okay and I'm giving digital

207
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,998
signatures just as an example. For every
primitive we describe we're gonna

208
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:06,464
precisely define what the threat model is.
Then we're gonna propose a construction

209
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:10,931
and then we're gonna give a proof that any
attacker that's able to attack the

210
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:15,955
construction under this threat model. That
attacker can also be used to solve some

211
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:20,150
underlying hard problem. And as a result,
if the problem really is hard, that

212
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,350
actually proves that no attacker can break
the construction under the threat model.

213
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,843
Okay. But these three steps are actually
quite important. In the case of

214
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,928
signatures, we'll define what it means for
a signature to be, forgeable, then we'll

215
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:35,914
give a construction, and then for example
we'll say that anyone who can break our

216
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:39,801
construction can then be used to say
factor integers, which is believed to be a

217
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,541
hard problem. Okay, so we're going to
follow these three steps throughout, and

218
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:47,331
then you'll see how this actually comes
about. Okay, so this is the end of the

219
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:51,218
segment. And then in the next segment
we'll talk a little bit about the history

220
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,006
of cryptography.
