00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,473
Over the years many natural cryptographic
constructions were found to be insecure.

2
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:08,560
In response, modern cryptography was
developed as a rigorous science where

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,033
constructions are always accompanied by a
proof of security. The language used to

4
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:17,341
describe security relies on discreet
probability. In this segment and the next,

5
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:21,538
I'll give a brief overview of discreet
probability, and I point to this Wiki

6
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:26,196
books article over here for a longer
introduction. Discrete probability is

7
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:31,573
always defined over a universe which I'll
denote by u and this universe in our case

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:36,630
is always going to be a finite set. In
fact very commonly our universe is going

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,944
to be simply the set of all n bit strings
which here is denoted by zero one to the

10
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:47,193
n. So for example the set zero one squared
is the set of all two bit strings which

11
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:52,207
happens to be the string zero, zero, zero
one, One, zero, and one, one. So there are

12
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:56,991
four elements in this set, and more
generally in the set zero one to the N,

13
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:01,809
there are two to the N elements. Now a
probability distribution over this

14
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:07,240
universe U is simply a function which I'll
denote by P, and this function, what it

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,470
does, is it assigns to every element in
the universe a number between zero and

16
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,567
one. And this number is what I'll call the
weight or the probability of that

17
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:22,663
particular element in the universe. Now
there's only one requirement on this

18
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:27,830
function P, and that is that the sum of
all the weights, sum up to one. That is,

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,573
if I sum the probability of all elements X
in the universe, what I end up with is the

20
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:38,911
number one. So let's look at a very simple
example looking back to our 2-bit

21
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:44,249
universe. So 0001, ten and eleven And you
can consider the following probability

22
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:49,452
distribution Which, for example, assigns
to the element 00, the probability one

23
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:54,267
half. The elements 01, we assign the
probability 1/8th, to ten we assign the

24
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:59,367
probability one quarter and to eleven we
assign the probability 1/8th. Okay we can

25
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:04,343
see that if we sum up these numbers in
fact we get one which means that this

26
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:09,380
probability P is in fact the probability
distributio N. Now what these number mean

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,542
is that if I sample from this probability
distribution I'll get the string 00 with

28
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:19,766
probability one half I'll get the string
01 with probability 1/8th and so on and so

29
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:24,612
forth. So now that we understand what a
probability distribution is, let's look at

30
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:29,025
two classic examples of probability
distributions. The first one is what's

31
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:33,437
called the uniform distribution. The
uniform distribution assigns to every

32
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:38,350
element in the universe, exactly the same
weight. I'm gonna use U between two bars

33
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,569
to denote the size of the universe U. That
is the number of elements in the universe,

34
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:48,665
and since we want the sum of all the
weights to sum out to one, and we want all

35
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:53,449
these weights to be equal, what this means
is that for every element X in the

36
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:58,622
universe, we assign a probability of one
over U. So in particular if we look at our

37
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:03,642
example, the uniform distribution and the
set of two [inaudible] strings, would

38
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:09,048
simply assign one-quarter the weight,
one-quarter to each one of these strings

39
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:13,875
And clearly that, the sum of all the
weights sums up to one. Well again, what

40
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:19,217
this means is that if I sample at random
from this distribution, I'll get a uniform

41
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:24,687
sample across all our 2-bit strings So all
of these 4-bit strings are equally likely

42
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:29,848
to be sampled by this distribution.
Another distribution that's very common is

43
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:35,734
what's called a point distribution at the
point X0 And what this point distribution

44
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:41,145
does is basically it puts all the weight
on a single point, namely X0. So here we

45
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:46,422
assign to the point X0 all the weight, one
And then to all other points in the

46
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:51,937
universe, we assign the weight zero And by
the way, I want to point out that this,

47
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:57,953
inverted, A here should be read as, for
all. So all this says is, that for all X

48
00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:02,963
that are not equal to X zero, the
probability of that X is zero. So again

49
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:08,124
going back to our example a point
distribution for example, that would put

50
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:13,352
all its mass on the string 1-0, would
assign probability one to the string 1-0

51
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:19,184
and zero to all other strings. So now if I
sample from this distribution pretty much

52
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:24,881
I'm always guaranteed to always sample the
string 1-0 and never sample any of the

53
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:29,556
other strings. So now we know what a
distribution is, and I just want to make

54
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:34,196
one last point, and that is that because
this universe U is always gonna be a

55
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:38,355
finite set up for us, we can actually
write down the weights that the

56
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:43,236
distribution assigns to every element in
U, and represent the entire distribution

57
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:47,881
as a vector. So, here for example, if you
look at the universe of an all 3-bit

58
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:52,985
strings, we can literally write down the
ways that the distribution assigns to the

59
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:58,089
string 000, then the way that distribution
assigns to the string 001 And so on, and

60
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:03,255
so forth. We you can see that we can write
this as a vector, in this case it will be

61
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:08,484
a vector of dimension eight, there will
be, there are eight strings of 3-bits as a

62
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:13,650
result basically the entire distribution
is captured by this vector of eight real

63
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,874
numbers, in the range of all zero to one.
The next thing I wanna do is define the

64
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:24,412
concept of an event. So consider a subset
A of our universe And I, I'll define the

65
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:30,086
probability of the subsets to be simply
the sum of the weights of all the elements

66
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:35,419
in the set A. In other words, I'm summing
over all X and A, the weights of these

67
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,038
elements X in the set A, Now because the
sum over the entire universe of all

68
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:44,278
weights needs to be one. This means that
if we sum, well if you look at the

69
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:48,517
probability of the entire universe,
basically we get one. And if we look at

70
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:52,813
the probability of a subset of the
universe, we're gonna get some number in

71
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:57,683
the interval zero to one And we say that
the probability of this set A, is the sum

72
00:05:57,683 --> 00:06:02,265
which is a number between zero and one.
And I'll tell you that a subset A of the

73
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:06,839
universe is called an event. And the
probability of the set A is called the

74
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,714
probability of that event. So let's look
at a simple example. So suppose we look at

75
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:19,135
the universe u, which consists of all
8-bit strings, right? So the size of this

76
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:26,057
universe u is 256 because there are 256
8-bit strings. Essentially we're looking

77
00:06:26,057 --> 00:06:32,352
at all byte values, all 256 possible byte
values. Now let's define the following

78
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:37,677
event. Basically the event is gonna
contain all bytes so all [inaudible]

79
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:44,038
extremes in the universe such that the two
least significant bits of the byte happens

80
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:50,324
to be eleven So for example, if we look at
01011010 that's an element in the universe

81
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:56,132
that's not in the set A, but if we choose
a zero to a one. Then that's an element of

82
00:06:56,132 --> 00:07:01,275
the universe which gives in our set A. And
now let's look at the uniform distribution

83
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:05,990
over the universe U and let me ask you
what is the probability of the, of the

84
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,565
event A? So what is the probability that
when we choose a random byte, the two

85
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:16,947
least significant bits of that byte
happens to be one, one? Well the answer is

86
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:23,435
one-fourth, and the reason that's true is
because it's not too difficult to convince

87
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:29,381
yourself that of the 256 eight bit
strings, exactly 64 of them, one quarter

88
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:34,118
of them, end in one, one. And the
probability of each string is, we're

89
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:38,722
looking at the uniform distribution or
probability of each string is exactly one

90
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:43,213
over the size of the universe, mainly one
over 256. And the product of these, you

91
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,817
know, 64 elements, each one has weight one
over 256 is exactly one-fourth, which is

92
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:52,764
the probability of the event A that we're
looking at. So a very simple bound on the

93
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:57,987
probability of events is called the union
bound. So imagine we have two events a1

94
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:03,135
and a2. So these are both subsets of some
universe U Snd we wanna know what is the

95
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:07,564
probability that either A1 occurs, or A2
occurs In other words, what is the

96
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:12,113
probability of the union of these two
events? This little U here denotes the

97
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:17,081
union of the two sets. So the union bound
tells us that the probability that either

98
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:22,041
A1 occurs or A2 occurs is basically less
than the sum of the two probabilities. And

99
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:26,560
that's actually quite easy to see. So
simply look at this picture here, you can

100
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,022
see that when we look at, at the sum of
the two probabilities, we're basically

101
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:35,483
summing the probability of all the
elements in A1, all the elements in A2 And

102
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:40,002
you realized, we kind of double-summed
these elements in the intersec tion. They

103
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:44,966
get summed twice here on the right hand
side And as a result, the sum of the two

104
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:50,351
probabilities is going to be larger or
larger than or equal to, the actual

105
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:56,102
probability of the union of A1 and A2. So
that's the classic union bound And in fact

106
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:01,169
I'll tell you that if the two events are
disjoint, in other words they're

107
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:06,792
intersection is empty, in that case if we
look at the sum, at the probability that

108
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:12,553
either A-1 or A02 happens, that's exactly
equal to the sum of the two probabilities.

109
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:18,637
Okay? So we'll use these facts here and
there throughout the course. So just to be

110
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:24,378
clear, the inequality holds always But
when the two events are disjoint, then in

111
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:30,258
fact we get an equality over here. So
let's look at a simple example. Suppose

112
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:36,265
our, event A1 is the set of all n-bit
stings that happen to end in 1-1 And

113
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:42,778
suppose A2 is the set of all n-bit strings
that happen to begin with 1-1. Okay, so N

114
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:47,607
thinks of it as H or some large number and
I'm asking that what is the probability

115
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:51,729
that either a one happens or a two
happens, In other words if I sample

116
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:56,205
uniformly from the universe U, what is the
probability that either the least

117
00:09:56,205 --> 00:10:00,916
significant bits are one, one or the most
significant digits are one, one. Well as

118
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:05,626
we said that's basically the probability
of the union of A1 and A2. We know that

119
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:10,279
the probability of each one of these
events is one-quarter by what we just did

120
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,813
previous slide And therefore by the union
[inaudible] the probability of the

121
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:19,018
[inaudible]. Is, you know, a quarter of
the probability of A1, plus the

122
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:23,763
probability of A2, which is a quarter plus
a quarter. And we just proved that the

123
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:28,448
probability of seeing 1-1 in the most
significant bit, or 1-1 least significant

124
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:33,198
bit, is less than one-half. So that's a
simple example of how we might go about

125
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:37,888
using the Union Bound to bound the
probability that one of two events might

126
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,842
happen. The next concept we need to
define, is what's called a random

127
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:46,520
variable. Now, random variables are fairly
intuitive objects. But unfortunately the

128
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,197
formal definition of a random variable can
be a little c onfusing. So what I'll do

129
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:55,702
is, I'll give an example, and hopefully
that will be clear enough. So formally, a

130
00:10:55,702 --> 00:11:00,264
random variable denoted say, by X. Is a
function, from the universe into some set

131
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:05,115
V And we say that this set V is where the
random variable takes its values. So let's

132
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:09,991
look at a particular example. So suppose
we have a random variable x And this

133
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:15,185
random variable maps into the set 01. So
the values of this random variable are

134
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:20,183
going to be either zero or one. So, one
bit, basically. Now, this random variable

135
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:25,504
maps our universe, which is the center of
all end bit binary strings, 01 to the end

136
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:30,112
And how does it do it? Well, given a
particular sample in the universe, a

137
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:34,775
particular end-bit string y. What the
random variable will do is simply output

138
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:39,525
the least significant bit of y And that's
it. That's the whole random variable. So,

139
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:44,093
now let me ask you. Suppose we look at a
uniform distribution on the set zero one

140
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:48,108
to the end. Let me ask you what is the
probability that this random variable

141
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:52,352
output zero and what is the probability
that a random variable outputs one? Well

142
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:56,920
you can see that the answers are half and
half. Well let's just lead them through

143
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,151
why that's the case. So here we have a
picture showing the universe and the

144
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,719
possible alpha space. And so in this case
the variable can output a zero or a one.

145
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:10,119
When there is a variable output zero,
there is a variable output zero when the

146
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:14,801
sample in the universe happens to be, to
have its least inefficient [inaudible] bid

147
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:19,111
be set to zero. In variable one, output
one When the sample in the universe

148
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:23,723
happens to have its least significant bit
set to one. Well, if choose strings

149
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:28,516
uniformly at random, the probability that
we choose a string that has its least

150
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:33,250
significant bits set to zero is exactly
one half Which the random variable output

151
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,305
zero with a probability of exactly
one-half. Similarly, if we choose a random

152
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:41,627
end-bit string, the probability that the
least significant bit is equal to one is

153
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:45,682
also one-half. And so we say that the
random variable output's one, also with

154
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,820
exactly proba bility of one-half. Now,
more generally, if we have a random

155
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,118
variable taking values in a certain set v,
then this random variable actually induces

156
00:12:55,118 --> 00:13:00,042
a distribution on this set v. And here, I
just wrote a, kind of a, in symbols, what

157
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:05,216
this distribution means But it's actually
very easy to explain. Essentially, what it

158
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:10,871
says is that the variable outputs v
Basically, with the same probability that

159
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:15,631
if we sample a random element in the
universe, and, and then we apply the

160
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:20,648
function x. We ask, how likely is it that
the output is actually=to v? So formally

161
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:25,620
we say that the probability that X outputs
V, is the same as the probability of the

162
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,411
event That when we sample a random element
in the universe, we fall into the pre

163
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:35,024
image of V under the function X And again,
if this wasn't clear, it's not that

164
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:39,516
important. All you need to know is that a
random variable takes values in a

165
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:44,014
particular set V, and in, induces a
distribution on that set V. Now there's a

166
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:48,902
particularly important random variable
called a uniform random variable. And it's

167
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:53,910
basically defined as you would expect. So
let's say that U is some fine [inaudible]

168
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,557
set For example the set of all N bit
binary strings, and we're gonna denote a

169
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:03,203
random variable R that's basically
sample's uniformly from the set U by this

170
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:08,109
little funny arrow with a little R on top
of it. In this, again the notes that the

171
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:13,164
random variable R is literally a uniform
random variable sampled over the set U. So

172
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:17,792
in symbols what's this means is that for
all elements A in the universe, the

173
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:22,907
probability that R is equal to A is simply
R one over U. And if you want to stick to

174
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:27,901
the formal definition of a, of a uniform
variable, it's not actually that important

175
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:33,017
But I would just say that formally the
uniform random variable is an identity

176
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:38,341
function namely R [inaudible] is equal to
X for all X in the universe So just to see

177
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:43,716
that this is clear, let me ask you a
simple puzzle. Suppose we have a uniform

178
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:49,375
random variable over 2-bit strings, so
over the set, 01, ten, one and now, let's

179
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:55,317
define a new random variable X to basicall
y sum the first and second bits of R. That

180
00:14:55,317 --> 00:15:01,117
is, X simply is the sum of R1 and R2, the
first and second bits of R, treating those

181
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:06,914
bits as integers. So, for example, if, r
happens to be 00, then x will be zero+0,

182
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:13,400
which is zero. So let me ask you, what is
the probability that x is = to two? So

183
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,289
it's not difficult to see that the answer
is exactly, one-fourth because, basically

184
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:24,777
the only way that x is equal to two is if
r happens to be 1,1 but the probability

185
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:29,930
that r is equal to 1,1 is basically
one-fourth because r is uniform over the

186
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,409
set of all two bit stings. The last
concept I want to define in this segment

187
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:38,629
is what's called a randomized algorithm.
So I'm sure you're all familiar with

188
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:42,355
deterministic algorithms. These are
algorithms that basically take a

189
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:47,068
particular, input data, as input, and they
always produce the same output, say Y. So

190
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:51,671
if we run the algorithm a hundred times on
the same input, we'll always get the same

191
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:55,617
output. So you can think of a
deterministic algorithm as a function that

192
00:15:55,617 --> 00:16:00,056
given a particular input data, M, will
always produce exactly the same output, A

193
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:05,345
of M. A randomized algorithm is a little
different, in that, as before, it takes

194
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:11,197
the [inaudible] and as input, but it also
has an implicit argument called R, where

195
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:16,770
this R is sampled anew every time the
algorithm is run. And in particular this R

196
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:21,925
is sampled uniformly at random from the
set of all N-bit strings, for some

197
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:26,716
arbitrary end. Now what happens is every
time we run the algorithm on a particular

198
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:31,172
input M we're gonna get a different output
because a different R is generated every

199
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:35,044
time. So the first time we run the
algorithm we get one output. The second

200
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:39,128
time we run the algorithm a new R is
generated and we get a different output.

201
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:43,530
The third time we run the algorithm a new
R is generated and we get a third output

202
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:48,742
and so on. So really the way to think
about a randomized algorithm is it's

203
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:53,689
actually defining a random variable.
Right? So given a particular input

204
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:59,201
message, M, it's defining a random
variable which is, defining a distribution

205
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:04,533
over the set of a [laugh] possible outputs
of this algorithm, given the input, M. So

206
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:09,222
the thing to remember is that the output
of a randomized algorithm changes every

207
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:14,085
time you run it And in fact, the algorithm
defines a distribution and the set of all

208
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:18,480
possible outputs. So let's look at a
particular example. So suppose we have a

209
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,266
randomized algorithm that takes as input a
message M And of course it also takes an

210
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:27,533
implicate input which is this random
string that is used to randomize its

211
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:32,838
operation. So now what the algorithm will
do is simply will encrypt the message M

212
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:38,300
using the random string as input. So this
basically defines a random variable. This

213
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,495
random variable takes values that are
encryptions of the message M And really

214
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:48,557
what this random, random variable is it's
a distribution over the set of all

215
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:53,532
possible encryptions of the message M
under a uniform key. So the main point to

216
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:58,087
remember is that even though the inputs to
a randomized algorithm might always be the

217
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:02,219
same every time you run the randomized
algorithm you're gonna get a different

218
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:05,836
output. Okay So, that concludes this
segment, and we'll see a bit more discrete

219
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,320
probability in the next segment.
