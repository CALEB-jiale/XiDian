1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,843
In this module I wanna show you another
approach to key exchange based on the

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:07,714
concept of public key encryption. So again
just to remind you of the settings, we

3
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:11,916
have our friends Alice and Bob as usual,
and they're both to exchange a secret key

4
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:15,402
K. The eavesdropper gets to see the
messages they send to one another, but

5
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:19,270
even though he shouldn't learn anything
about the key K that, that they exchanged.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,900
And as usual in this module we're only
going to be looking at eavesdropping

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,725
security. That is we don't allow the
attacker to tamper with data or to mount

8
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:30,719
any other form of active attack. So, just
to remind you, earlier in this module we

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,514
saw an inefficient mechanism based on
generic block ciphers. In the previous

10
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:38,009
segment we saw the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange mechanism which has an

11
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:42,153
exponential gap between the work that the
participants have to do versus the work

12
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:46,198
that the attacker has to do. And in fact
this Diffie-Hellman protocol is used all

13
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,992
over the web very frequently. In this
segment I want to show you, a different

14
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:54,309
approach based on public key encryption.
So, what is public encryption? So just as

15
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:58,891
in the case of symmetric encryption, there's an encryption algorithm and a

16
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:03,415
decryption algorithm. However, here the
encryption algorithm is given one key,

17
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:07,764
which we're going to call a public key.
Let's call this the public key that

18
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:12,172
belongs to Bob. And the decryption algorithm is given a different key, we'll

19
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:16,696
call it a secret key. That also belongs to
Bob. So these two keys are sometimes

20
00:01:16,696 --> 00:01:24,144
called a key pair. One half of the pair is
the public key and the other half of the

21
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:28,752
pair is the secret key. Now the way you
encrypt this as usual, a message would

22
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:33,187
come in, the encryption algorithm would
generate a cipher text, that is the

23
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:38,026
encryption of this message using the given
public key. And then when the cipher text

24
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:42,864
is given to the decryption algorithm, the
decryption algorithm basically outputs the

25
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:47,645
corresponding, message. So, as I said, PK
is called the public key and SK is called

26
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:52,308
the secret key. So more precisely, what is
public encryption? Well, public encryption

27
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:56,957
is actually made up of three algorithms,
G, E, and D. Algorithm G is what's called

28
00:01:56,957 --> 00:02:01,492
a key generation algorithm. When you run
algorithm G, it will output two keys, the

29
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:05,744
public key and the secret key. The
encryption algorithm basically, given the

30
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:10,053
public key in the message, will output the
corresponding cipher text. And the

31
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:14,418
decryption algorithm, given the secret key
in the cipher text, will output the

32
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:19,332
message or it will output bottom if an
error occurred. And as usual we have the

33
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:24,269
usual consistency properties that say that
for any public key and secret key that

34
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,148
could have been output by the key generation
algorithm if we encrypt the message using

35
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:33,794
the public key and then decrypt using the
secret key we should get the original

36
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:38,313
message back. Now, what does it mean for a
public key system to be secure? Well, we

37
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:42,975
use the same concept of semantic security
that we used before, except the game is now

38
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:47,300
a little bit different. So let me
explain, how we define semantic security

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,737
for a public key system. So here, the
challenger is gonna run the key generation

40
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:56,287
algorithm to generate a public key and a
secret key pair, and he's gonna give the

41
00:02:56,287 --> 00:03:00,242
public key to the adversary. The
challenger keeps the secret key to

42
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:05,373
himself. What the adversary will do is he
will output two equal length messages M0 and

43
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:10,321
M1 as before and then the challenger will
give him the encryption of M0 or M1. As

44
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:15,147
usual we define two experiments: experiment
zero and experiment one. In experiment

45
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:20,279
zero the adversary is given the encryption
of M0. In experiment one the adversary is

46
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:24,860
given the encryption of M1 and then the
adversary's goal is to guess which

47
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,381
encryption he was given. Was he given the
encryption of M0 or was he given

48
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:34,945
encryption of M1. And we refer to his
guess as the output of experiment zero or

49
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:40,119
experiment one. One thing I want to
emphasize is that in the case of public

50
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:44,590
encryption there's no need to give the
attacker the ability to mount a chosen

51
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,083
plaintext attack. Why is that? Well in
the case of a symmetric key system, the

52
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:53,813
attacker had to request the encryption of
messages of his choice. In the case of a

53
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:58,081
public key system, the attacker has the
public key and therefore he can by

54
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:02,350
himself, encrypt for himself any message
that he wants. He doesn't need the

55
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,022
challenger's help to create encryptions of
messages of his choice. And as a result,

56
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:11,348
in a public key setting, a chosen
plaintext attack is inherent. There's no

57
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:16,035
reason to give the attacker extra power to
mount a chosen plaintexts attack. And

58
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:20,513
that's why we never discussed chosen
plaintext queries in the context of

59
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:25,210
defining semantic security for public key
systems. Now that we defined the game

60
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,539
we're going to say that a public key system
GED is semantically secure if

61
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:34,093
basically the attacker cannot distinguish
experiment zero from experiment one. In

62
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:38,534
other words, the adversary's probability
of outputting one in experiment zero is

63
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:42,920
about the same as his probability of
outputting one in experiment one. So again,

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,024
the attacker can't tell whether he was
given the encryption of M0 or the

65
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:51,694
encryption of M1. Now that we understand
what a public key encryption is let's see

66
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:56,151
how to use it to establish a shared
secret. See here are our friends Alice and

67
00:04:56,151 --> 00:05:00,666
Bob. Alice will start off by generating a
random public key secret key pair for

68
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,952
herself using the key generation
algorithm. And then she's going to send to

69
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:09,523
bob the public key PK. And she also says,
hey this message is from Alice. What Bob

70
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:14,324
will do is he will generate a random 128
bit value X and he will send back to Alice

71
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:19,124
saying hey this message is from Bob and he
will send back the encryption of X under

72
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:23,674
Alice's public key. Alice will receive
this cipher text, she will decrypt it

73
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:28,686
using her secret key and that will give
her the value X and now this value X can

74
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:34,339
be used basically as a shared secret
between the two of them. I wanna emphasize

75
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:38,966
that this protocol is very different from
the Diffie-Hellman protocol that we saw in

76
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:43,375
the last segment in the sense that here
the parties have to take turns, In the

77
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:47,730
sense that Bob cannot send his message
until he receives the message from Alice.

78
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,316
In other words, Bob cannot encrypt X to
Alice's public key until he receives the

79
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:56,272
public key from Alice. In the
Diffie-Hellman protocol however the two

80
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,802
parties could send their messages at
arbitrary times and there was no ordering

81
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:04,808
enforced on those messages. As a result we
had this nice application of

82
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:08,887
Diffie-Hellman, where, everybody could
post their messages to Facebook, for

83
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:13,190
example. And then just by looking at
Facebook profiles, any pair would already

84
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,492
have a shared key, without any need for
additional communication. Here, this is

85
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:21,963
not quite true, even if everybody posts
their public key to Facebook, there would

86
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:26,380
still be a need to send this message
before a shared key can be established. So

87
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,997
now that we understand protocol the first
question we need to ask is why is this

88
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:35,556
protocol secure. And as usual we're only
gonna look at eavesdropping security. So

89
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:40,173
in this protocol the attacker gets to see
the public key and the encryption of X

90
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:44,960
under the public key and what he wants to
get is basically this value X. Now we know

91
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,748
that the system the public key system that
we used is semantically secure, what that

92
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:54,151
means is that the attacker cannot
distinguish the encryption of X, From the

93
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:59,164
encryption of something random. In other
words, just given encryption of X, the

94
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:04,164
attacker can't tell whether the plain text
is X or just some random junk that was

95
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:08,920
chosen from M, And because of that, that
basically says that just by looking at

96
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:13,980
messages in this protocol, the value of X
is indistinguishable in the attacker's

97
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,797
view from a random element in M and as a
result, X can be used as a session key

98
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:23,370
between the two parties. It's just a
random value which the attacker cannot

99
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,014
actually guess other than by trying all
possible values in M. Then I should say

100
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,483
that showing that these two distributions
are distinguishable follows directly from

101
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:36,234
semantic security and in fact it's a
simple exercise to show that if the

102
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:39,984
attacker could distinguish this
distribution from that distribution then

103
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:44,218
the attacker could also break semantic
security. And as usual even though this

104
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:48,816
protocol is secure against eavesdropping,
it's completely insecure against the

105
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:53,488
man-in-the-middle attack. So let's see a
simple man in the middle attack. Well so

106
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:58,257
here we have Alice generating her public
key secret key pair. At the same time the

107
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:02,561
man in the middle is also going to
generate his own public key secret key

108
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:07,156
pair. And now when Alice sends her public
key over to Bob, The man in the middle

109
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:11,808
will intercept that and instead he'll say
yeah this is a message from Alice, but

110
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:16,169
Alice's public key is p K prime. So now
Bob receives this message, he thinks he

111
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,461
got a message from Alice, what he'll send
back is, well he's going to choose his

112
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:24,535
random X, and he'll send back the
encryption of X under PK prime. The man in

113
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:28,882
the middle is going to intercept this
message, and he's going to replace it with

114
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:33,065
something else. So, his goal is to make
sure that the key exchange succeeds, in

115
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:37,412
other words Alice thinks that she got a
message from Bob, and yet the man in the

116
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:41,541
middle should know exactly what the
exchanged secret is. So what should the man in

117
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:47,211
the middle send to Alice in this case? So
yeah let's call the cipher text C. What

118
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:51,783
the man in the middle will do is he will
decrypt the cipher text C using his own

119
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:56,356
secret key that will reveal X to the man
in the middle. And then he's going to go

120
00:08:56,356 --> 00:09:00,873
ahead and encrypt X under Alice's public
key, send the value back to Alice. Alice

121
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,220
will obtain this X and as far as she's
concerned, she just did a key exchange

122
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,849
with Bob, where both of them learned the
value X, but the problem of course is that

123
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:14,418
the man in the middle also knows the value
X. So this protocol becomes completely

124
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:19,264
insecure once the man in the middle can
tamper with messages from Alice to Bob and

125
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:23,772
from Bob to Alice. So again we have to do something to this protocol to make it secure and

126
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:28,280
we're gonna see how to do that, actually,
in two weeks after we introduce digital

127
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,557
signatures. So now that I've show you that
public encryption implies key exchange

128
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:36,633
security against eavesdropping. The next
question is how do we construct public key

129
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:40,761
encryption systems? And it turns out that
these constructions generally rely on

130
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:44,941
number theory and some algebra, and just
like the Diffie-Hellman protocol relied on

131
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:49,017
some algebra. And so before we go into
these protocols in more detail what I'd

132
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:53,406
like to do is kind of take a quick detour.
In the next module we're going to look at

133
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:57,743
the relevant number theory background.
We'll just do one module on this and then

134
00:09:57,743 --> 00:10:02,317
come back and talk about these public key
constructions and more constructions for

135
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:06,818
key exchange. So this is the end of this
module. And as further reading, I just

136
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:11,705
wanted to point to this paper that shows
if in fact all we do is rely on symmetric

137
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:16,062
ciphers and hash functions then
Merkle puzzles are optimal for key

138
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:20,713
exchange and in fact we cannot achieve
more than a quadratic gap as long as we

139
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:25,077
treat the primitives we're given as a
black box. So basically this shows that a

140
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:28,994
quadratic gap is the best possible and
also I wanted to point to another paper

141
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:33,110
that kind of summarizes some of these key
exchange mechanisms that we talked about,

142
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,176
key exchange using public key cryptography
and key exchange using Diffie-Hellman. You

143
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:41,342
can take a look at this paper and it kind
of will give you a look ahead into what's

144
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:45,557
coming and how to make these key exchange
protocols secure against man in the middle

145
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:49,956
and not just secure against eavesdropping.
Okay so that's the end of this module and

146
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:54,480
in the next module we'll take a brief
detour and do a kind of a brief overview

147
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,080
of algebra and number theory.
