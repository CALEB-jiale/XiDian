1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,372
Now that we know how two users can protect
data using a shared secret key, the next

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:08,218
question is how did these two users
generate a shared secret key to begin

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:12,538
with? This question will take us into the
world of public key cryptography. In this

4
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:16,647
module, we will look at a few toy key
exchange protocols as a way to introduce

5
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:21,020
the main ideas of public key cryptography.
We're gonna come back and talk about key

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,388
exchange and design secure key exchange
protocols after we build a few more public

7
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:29,249
key tools. So imagine for a second that
there a N users in the world. And the

8
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:33,335
question is, how do these users manage
these secret keys that they're gonna use

9
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:37,612
to communicate with one another? So, for
example, let's assume N equals four and

10
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:41,628
there are four users in the world. One
option is that basically every pair of

11
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:46,913
users will share a shared secret key. And
so, for example, U1 and U3 will share a

12
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:52,522
shared, a shared secret key. I'll call it
K13. U1 and U2 will share a, a shared

13
00:00:52,522 --> 00:01:01,302
secret key. We'll call it K12 so on and so
forth. K24 K34 and so on and so forth. K14

14
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:08,669
and finally K23. The problem with this
approach is that now there are many, many

15
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:13,569
shared keys that users have to manage. And
in particular, every user has to store on

16
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:18,231
the order of N keys if he's gonna talk to
N other parties in this world. So the

17
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:23,116
question is can we do any better than
storing N keys per user? And the answer is

18
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:27,766
yes. And one way to do that is what's
called an online trusted third party. I'll

19
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:32,356
use TTP to denote that trusted third
party. So the way we are going to use the

20
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:37,418
trusted third party is every user will now
share a single key with this trusted third

21
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:42,244
party. So user one will share a secret
key, user two will share a secret key. And

22
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:47,431
here are our friends Alice and Bob, let's
call their secret keys k sub A and k sub B.

23
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:51,543
Okay, so now the nice thing about
this design is that now every user only

24
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:56,619
has to remember one secret key. The
question is now, what happens when Alice

25
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:01,114
wants to talk to Bob? Somehow the two of
them have to engage in a certain protocol,

26
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:06,857
such that at the end of this protocol they
will have a shared secret key KAB that the

27
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:11,657
attacker wouldn't be able to know. And so
the question is how do Alice and Bob

28
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:16,988
generate this shared secret key KAB. So
let's look at an example toy protocol for

29
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:22,167
doing that. So here we have our friends
Alice and Bob. As usual Bob has his key

30
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:27,469
KB, which is shared with a trusted third
party. Alice has her secret key KA,

31
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:30,916
which is also shared with a trusted third
party. So here the trusted third party

32
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:37,355
has both KA and KB. And the question is,
how do they generate a shared key that

33
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:41,392
they both agree on, but the attacker would
have no idea what this shared key is? So

34
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:45,233
here we're only gonna look at a toy
protocol. In particular, this protocol is

35
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,729
only gonna to be secure against
eavesdropping. It's not gonna be secure

36
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,520
against more tampering or active attacks.
As I said, we're gonna come back and

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,459
design secure key exchange protocols later
on in the course. But for now, just to

38
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,497
introduce this idea of key exchange, let's
look at the simplest, simplest mechanism

39
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:04,535
that's only secure against eavesdropping.
So in other words, adversary that listens

40
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:09,635
to the conversation won't know what
the shared key KAB is gonna be. And so the

41
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:13,931
protocol works as follows. Alice is going
to start by sending a message to the

42
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:17,683
trusted third party saying, hey I want a
secret key that's going to be shared with

43
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:21,779
Bob. What the trusted third party will do
is it will actually go ahead and choose a

44
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:26,844
random secret key, KAB. So the trusted
third party is the one who's gonna

45
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:30,402
generate their shared secret key. And what
it will do with this key is the following.

46
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:34,909
It's gonna send one message back to
Alice. But this message consists of, of

47
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:39,873
two parts. The first part of the message
is an encryption using Alice's secret key,

48
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:45,018
using the key KA, of the message this key
is supposed to be used between parties

49
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:50,101
Alice and Bob, and she includes the secret
key KAB inside the message. Okay? So just

50
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:55,370
to be clear, what's happening here is that
the message that gets encrypted is the key

51
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,144
KAB plus the fact that this key is
supposed to be a shared key between Alice

52
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:04,467
and Bob. Okay. And this whole message is
encrypted using Alice's secret key. The

53
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:08,840
other part of the message that the TTP
sends to Alice is what's called a ticket.

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,995
And this ticket is basically a message
that's encrypted for Bob. So in other

55
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:17,150
words, the ticket is gonna be an
encryption under the key KB of, again, the

56
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,138
fact that this key is supposed to be used
between Alice and Bob. And she

57
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:26,019
concatenates to that the, the secret key,
KAB. Okay, so again, the message that's

58
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:31,144
encrypted inside of the ticket is the fact
that this key is to be used by Alice and

59
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:35,991
Bob. And, the secret key, KAB, is included
in the ticket as well. Okay, So these two

60
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:40,073
messages, Here, let me circle them. These
two messages are sent from the trusted

61
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:45,438
third party to Alice. Now I should mention
that the encryption system E that is

62
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:49,365
actually being used here is a CPA secure
cipher and we'll see why that's needed in

63
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:52,973
just a minute. So, this is the end of the
conversation between Alice and this

64
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:56,190
trusted third party. Basically as we
said at the end of this conversation,

65
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,114
Alice receives one message that's
encrypted for her and another message

66
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:04,691
called a ticket that's encrypted for Bob.
Now at a later time when Alice wants to

67
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:08,586
communicate securely with Bob what she
will do, is of course, she will decrypt

68
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:12,855
her part of the message. In other words
she will decrypt the cipher text that was

69
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:19,341
encrypted using the key KA and now she has
the key KAB. And then to Bob, she's going

70
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:23,240
to send over this ticket. Bob is going
to receive the ticket and he is going to

71
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,068
use his own secret key KB to decrypt it and
then he himself will also recover the

72
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:34,260
secret key KAB. So now they have the
shared secret key KAB that they can use

73
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,024
to communicate securely with one another.
And the first question to ask is, Why is

74
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:43,327
this protocol secure? Even if we only
consider eavesdropping adversaries. So,

75
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,975
let's think about that for a minute. So,
at the moment all we care about is just

76
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:51,053
security against an eavesdropper, So let's
think. What does an eavesdropper see in

77
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:54,976
this protocol. Well basically he sees
these two cipher texts. Right, he sees the

78
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:58,933
cipher text that's encrypted for Alice.
And then he sees the ticket that's

79
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:02,685
encrypted for Bob. And in fact he might
see many instances of these messages, in

80
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:07,271
particular if Alice and Bob continuously
exchange keys in this way he's gonna see

81
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:11,557
many messages of this type and our goal is
to say that he has no information about

82
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:17,088
the exchanged key KAB. So this follows
directly from the CPA security of the

83
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:21,875
cipher E D because the eavesdropper can't
really distinguish between encryptions of

84
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:26,893
the secret key KAB from encryption of just
random junk. That's the definition of CPA

85
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:31,614
security and as a result, he can't
distinguish the key KAB from, you know,

86
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:35,659
random junk which means that he learns
nothing about KAB. This is kind of a very

87
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:40,561
high level argument for why this is
eavesdropping security but it's enough for

88
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:45,465
our purposes here. So the bottom line is
that in this protocol the eavesdropper

89
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:49,313
would actually have no information about
what KAB is. And therefore it's okay to

90
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:55,277
use KAB as secret key to exchange messages
between Alice and Bob. Now let's think

91
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:59,717
about the TTP for a minute. So first of
all, you notice that the TTP is needed for

92
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:03,500
every single key exchange. So basically
Alice and Bob simply cannot do key change

93
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,016
unless the TTP is online and available to
help them do that. And the other property

94
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:12,408
of this protocol is in fact, the TTP knows
all the session keys. So if somehow the

95
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:17,753
TTP is corrupt, or maybe it's broken into,
then an attacker can very easily steal all

96
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:22,471
the secret keys that have been exchanged
between every user of this system. This is

97
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:26,884
why this TTP is called the Trusted Third
Party because, essentially, it knows all

98
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:32,030
the session keys that have been generated
in the system. Nevertheless the beauty of

99
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,509
this mechanism is that it only uses
symmetric key cryptography, nothing beyond

100
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,504
what we've already seen and as a result it is
very fast and efficient. The only issue is

101
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:46,213
that you have to use this online trusted
party and it's not immediately clear if for

102
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:50,749
example we wanted to use this in the
world wide web who would function as this

103
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:55,165
online trusted third party. However, in a
corporate setting this might actually make

104
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:58,408
sense if you have a single company with a
single point of trust it might make sense

105
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:02,681
to actually designate a machine as a
trusted third party. And in fact a

106
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:07,599
mechanism like this not quite as the way I
described it, but a mechanism like this is

107
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,586
the basis of the Kerberos system. So
this is our first example of a key

108
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:15,759
exchange protocol that allowed Alice and
Bob to set up shared keys, however I

109
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,262
really want to point out that this is just
a toy protocol. Very, very simple and is

110
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:24,545
only secure against eavesdropping
attack. It's actually completely insecure

111
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:28,773
against an active attacker. And here's a
very simple example of how an active

112
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:33,220
attacker might destroy this protocol, and
so let's just look at replay attacks. So

113
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,668
here imagine the attacker records the
conversation between Alice and some online

114
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:42,289
merchant. Let's call him Merchant Bob. So
for example, imagine Alice orders a book

115
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,588
from the merchant Bob and the transaction
completes and Bob accepts payment for this

116
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:52,265
book. And actually sends Alice a copy
of this book. What an attacker can do now

117
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:56,459
is, he can complete, completely record the
conversation and simply replay the

118
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,654
conversation to merchant Bob at a later
time. Bob will think that Alice just

119
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:04,903
reordered another, another copy of the
book and he'll charge her again for it,

120
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:08,903
and send her this, this copy again. So
essentially by replaying a conversation

121
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:12,656
you can cause quite a bit of harm to
Alice, and as a result this is a simple

122
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:16,557
example of why this protocol is completely
insecure against active attacks, and

123
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:20,705
should never be used in the real world. As
I said we're going to come back in a few weeks

124
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:24,804
and talk about secure versions of this
protocol, and you'll see how to make this

125
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:29,421
work, in the real world. Nevertheless, you
see that this, this very simple protocol

126
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:33,378
already raises a very interesting
question. And the question is, can we

127
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:37,392
basically design key exchange protocols
whether they're secure against

128
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:41,595
eavesdropping or secure against active
attackers. The question is, can we design

129
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:46,549
key exchange protocols that are secure,
but work without an online trusted third

130
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:50,901
party. So we don't wanna rely on any
online trusted party that's necessary to

131
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:55,506
complete the key exchange protocol. And so
the amazing answer is that in fact this is

132
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:59,656
possible. We can do key exchange without a
trusted third party. And this is, in fact,

133
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:03,859
the starting point of public cryptography.
So I'm gonna show you three ideas for

134
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:08,114
making this happen and we're gonna talk
about them in much more detail in the, in

135
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:12,419
the coming modules. So the first idea is
actually due to Ralph Merkle back in 1974.

136
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,644
This was, he was, when he was just an
undergraduate student. And already he came

137
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:20,924
up with this really nice idea for key
exchange without an online trusted third

138
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:24,545
party. So that's one example that
we're gonna look at. Another example is

139
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:28,326
due to Diffie and Hellman. Back in 1976
they both actually, working here at

140
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:32,641
Stanford University, came up with this idea
that launched the world of modern key

141
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:38,202
cryptography. And the third idea is due to
Rivest, Shamir and Adleman working at MIT and

142
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:42,846
we're going to look in detail exactly how
each of these ideas work. But I do want to

143
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:46,435
mention that the work on public key
management hasn't stopped in the late

144
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:49,867
seventies. In fact there have been many
ideas over the years and here I'll just

145
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:53,683
mention two from the last decade. One is
call identity based encryption, which is

146
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:57,998
another way for managing public keys. And
another is called functional encryption,

147
00:10:57,998 --> 00:11:03,322
which is a way of giving secret keys that
only partially decrypt a given cipher text.

148
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,719
And so we're gonna talk about the core of
public key crypto in this and the next week

149
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:11,580
and we'll talk about these more advanced
ideas later on in the course.
