1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,819
In the last segment we talked about the
CBC-MAC and the NMAC, but throughout

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,819
上一节课我们讨论了CBC-MAC和NMAC

3
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:07,688
the segment we always assumed that the
message length was a multiple of the block

4
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:07,688
但是在那一节里我们总是假定明文长度是分组长度的倍数

5
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:12,234
size. In this segment, we're going to see
what to do when the message length is not

6
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:12,234
在这节里 我们来看看当明文长度不是分组长度的倍数时该怎么做

7
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:16,817
a multiple of the block size. So recall
that the encrypted CBC mac or ECBC-MAC for

8
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:16,817
因此回忆一下 加密CBC-MAC或者简称为ECBC-MAC

9
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:21,401
short uses pseudorandom permutation F to
actually compute the CBC function as we

10
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:21,401
使用伪随机置换F来计算CBC函数

11
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:25,928
discussed in the last segment. But in the
last segment, we always assumed that the

12
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:25,928
这是我们上节讨论的 但是在上节里 我们总是假定

13
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:30,288
message itself could be broken into an
integer number of blocks for the block

14
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:30,288
明文本身可以分解成分组密码分组的整数倍

15
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:34,689
cipher. And the question is what to do
when the message length is not a multiple

16
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:34,689
那么问题就是当明文长度不是分组长度的整数倍是我们要怎么做

17
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,919
of the block size. So here we have a
message where the last block actually is

18
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,919
这里有一个明文信息 它的最后一个分组

19
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:43,258
shorter than the full block and the
question is how to compute the ECBC-MAC in

20
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:43,258
比满的分组要短 那么问题就是在这种情况下怎么计算ECBC-MAC

21
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:47,707
comes to mind is to simply pad the message
that case. So the solution of course is to
pad the message and the first pad that

22
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:47,707
答案就是填充明文 第一个想到的填充方法

23
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:52,376
with all zeros. In other words we take the

24
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:52,376
就是用全0来填充 换句话说

25
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:57,045
last block and just add zeros to it until
the last block becomes as long as one full

26
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:57,045
我们取最后一个分组 填充0直到它的长度等于满分组的长度

27
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:02,071
block size. And so my question to you is
whether the resulting MAC is secure. So

28
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:02,071
那么我给大家的问题是这样产生MAC是否是安全的

29
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:06,911
the answer is no, the MAC is not secure.
And let me explain why, basically the

30
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:06,911
答案是否 这个MAC不安全 我来解释下为什么

31
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:12,324
problem is that it's possible now to come
up with messages so that message m and the

32
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:12,324
我们很可能找出一个明文m

33
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:17,738
message m concatenated zero happen to have
exactly the same Pad. And as a result once

34
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:17,738
明文m联结0之后恰巧有有同样的填充 结果

35
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:22,833
we plug in both m and m||0 into ECBC we'll
get the same tag out, which means that

36
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:22,833
一旦我们向ECBC-MAC里插入m和m||0 我们就会输出同样的标签 这就意味着

37
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,928
both m and m||0 have the
same tag and therefore the attacker can

38
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,928
m和m||0有同样的标签 因此攻击者能够

39
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:33,194
mount an existential forgery. He would ask
for the tag on the message m. And then he

40
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:33,194
实施一个存在性伪造 他会询问明文m的标签

41
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:38,344
would output as its forgery the tag and the
message m||0. And it's

42
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:38,344
然后他会输出伪造标签和明文m||0

43
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:43,432
easy to say why that's the case. Basically, to be absolutely clear here, we have our

44
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:43,432
这是很容易就能明白为什么是这样 更清楚地来说

45
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:48,272
message m. Which after padding becomes m000. So we had to add three

46
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:48,272
我们有明文m m在填充之后变成了m000.因此我们必须加三个0

47
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:53,298
0's to it. And here we have the message m
zero, an m that ends with zero. And after

48
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:53,298
另外我们有明文m||0 以0结尾的m

49
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:58,324
padding, we basically now have to add two
0's to it. And lo and behold, they become

50
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:58,324
在填充后 我们必须再加两个0 大家看

51
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:03,118
the same pad, so that they're gonna have
exactly the same tag which allows the

52
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:03,118
它们就有了同样的填充 那么它们也会有同样的标签

53
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,866
adversary to mount the existential forgery
attack. So this is not a good idea. In

54
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,866
这就使得敌手实施存在性伪造攻击 那么这就不是一个好方法

55
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:12,801
fact appending all 0s is a terrible idea.
And if you think about concrete case where

56
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:12,801
事实上附加全0是一个糟糕的方法 如果大家想想具体的情况

57
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:17,222
this comes up imagine the automatic
clearing house system used for clearing

58
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:17,222
就会有问题 想想自动清扫房间系统

59
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:21,794
checks. I might have a check for a $100
and the tag on that check. Well, now, the

60
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:21,794
被用来处理支票 我有一张100美元的支票 上面有标签 那么现在

61
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:25,943
attacker basically could append a zero to
my check and make it a check for $1000,

62
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:25,943
攻击者能在我的支票上附加0 使它变成1000美元的支票

63
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:30,093
and that wouldn't actually change the tag.
So this ability to extend the message

64
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:30,093
实际上这不会改变标签 这种扩展明文

65
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:34,294
without changing the tag actually could
have pretty disastrous consequences. So I

66
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:34,294
而不改变标签的能力实际上有非常灾难性的后果

67
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:38,547
hope this example convinces you that the
padding function itself must be a one to

68
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:38,547
所以我希望这个例子能使大家明白填充函数本身必须是一个一一映射的函数

69
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:42,904
one function. In other words, it should be
the case that two distinct messages always

70
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:42,904
换句话说 应该是这种情况 两个不同的明文

71
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:47,157
map to two distinct padded messages. We
shouldn't actually have a collision on the

72
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:47,157
映射到不同的两个填充的明文 我们不应该在填充函数上有碰撞

73
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:51,254
padding function. Another way of saying it
is that the padding function must be

74
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:51,254
或者说 填充函数必须是可逆的

75
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,033
invertible. That guarantees that the
padding function is one to one. So a

76
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,033
这就保证了填充函数是一一映射的

77
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:59,945
standard way to do this was proposed by
the International Standards Organization

78
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:59,945
因此一种标准的实现方法被国际标准化组织ISO提出

79
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:04,736
ISO. What they suggested is basically,
let's append the string 100000 to the end

80
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:04,736
他们提议把字符创100000附在明文后面

81
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:09,587
of the message to make the message be a
multiple of the block length. Now to see

82
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:09,587
是明文长度变成分组长度的倍数 现在来看

83
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:14,439
that this padding is invertible, all we do
is describe the inversion algorithm

84
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:14,439
这个填充就是可逆的 我们要做的就是描述这个可逆算法

85
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,230
which simply is gonna scan the message
from right to left, until it hits the

86
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,230
就是简单地从右到左扫描明文 直到找到

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,778
first one and then it's gonna remove all
the bits to the right of this one,

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,778
第一个1 然后移除这个1右面的所有比特

89
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,929
including the one. And you see that once
we've removed the pattern this way, we

90
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,929
包括这个1 并且你能看到一旦我们按这种方式移除一部分

91
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:32,355
obtain the original message. So here's an
example, so here we have a message where

92
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:32,355
我们就能得到原始的明文 这有一个例子 我们有一个明文

93
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:36,726
the last block happens to be shorter than
the block length, and then we

94
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:36,726
它的最后一个分组比分组长度短

95
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:40,878
append the 1,0,0 string to it.
It's very easy to see what the pad is,

96
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:40,878
我们就把1 0 0字符串附加在它后面 很容易就能看出来填充位是什么

97
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,249
simply look for the first one from the
right, we can remove this pad and recover

98
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,249
从右边看 找到第一个1 我们可以移除这些填充位

99
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:49,666
the original message back. Now there's one
corner case that's actually quite

100
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:49,666
然后我们就恢复了原始明文 现在有一种极端情况 实际上挺重要的

101
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:54,401
important, and that is what do we do if
the original message length is already the

102
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:54,401
那是如果原始明文已经是分组长度的倍数 我们该怎么办

103
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:59,440
multiple of a block size? In that case
it's really very, very important that we

104
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:59,440
那种情况下 这么做非常非常重要的

105
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,143
add an extra dummy block. That contains
the pad 1000. And again, I can't tell you

106
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,143
加一个假的分组 包括填充1000 我都不知道

107
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,279
how many products and standards have
actually made this mistake where they

108
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,279
有多少产品和标准犯过这种错误

109
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:12,691
didn't add a dummy block and as a result,
the MAC is insecure because there's an

110
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:12,691
他们没有加一个假分组 结果MAC就不安全了

111
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:17,159
easy existential forgery attack. And let
me show you why. So suppose in case the

112
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:17,159
因为这有一个很简单的存在性伪造攻击 我来给大家说明原因 假定这种情况下

113
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:21,736
message is a multiple of a block length,
suppose we didn't add a dummy block and we

114
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:21,736
明文长度是分组长度的倍数 我们没有附加假分组

115
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:26,202
literally MAC-ed this message here. Well,
the result now is that if you look at

116
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:26,202
我们计算这个信息的MAC 结果是

117
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:31,120
the message which is a multiple of the
block size and a message which is not a

118
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:31,120
如果你看这个信息长度是分组的倍数

119
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,915
multiple of the block size but is padded
to the block size, and imagine it so

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,915
还有一个信息的长度不是分组长度的倍数 但它被补齐到分组的大小了

121
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:40,782
happens that this message m prime one
happens to end with 1-0-0. At this point,

122
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:40,782
想象一下 这个信息m以100结尾

123
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:45,321
you realize that here, the original
message. Here, let me draw it this way.

124
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:45,321
这里大家发现 这个原信息 我这样画

125
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:50,133
You realize that the original message
after padding. Would become identical to

126
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:50,133
你发现原信息补齐之后

127
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:55,028
the second message that was not padded at
all. And as a result, if I ask for the tag

128
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:55,028
与第二个没补齐的相同

129
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,806
on this message over here, I would obtain
also the tag on the second message that

130
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,806
因此 如果我问这个信息的标签 我也获得了第二个以100结尾的信息的标签

131
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:04,288
happened to end in 1-0-0. Okay, so if we
didn't add the dummy block, basically,

132
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:04,288
好 如果我们不加假的分组

133
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:08,594
again, the pad would be not invertible,
because two different messages, two

134
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:08,594
补齐将不是可逆的 因为两个不同的信息

135
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:13,135
distinct messages, happen to map to the
same padded result. Again, as a result,

136
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:13,135
正好被映射到了相同的补齐结果

137
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:17,893
the MAC becomes insecure. So to summarize,
this ISO standard is a perfectly fine way

138
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:17,893
这样MAC就不安全了 总结一下 这个ISO标准是完美的补齐方法

139
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:22,535
to pad, except you have to remember also
to add a dummy block in case message is a

140
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:22,535
但大家要记住也要加假的分组

141
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:26,749
multiple of the block length to begin
with. Now some of you might be wondering

142
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:26,749
当信息长度是分组长度的倍数时 现在也许有人想知道

143
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:30,919
if there is a padding scheme that never
needs to add a dummy block, and the answer

144
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:30,919
是否有一种补齐方式 从不需要加假的分组

145
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,139
is that if you look at a deterministic
padding function, then it's pretty easy to

146
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,139
答案是 如果你看确定的补齐函数

147
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,054
argue that there will always be cases
where we need to pad, and the reason is

148
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,054
容易证明所有情况下我们都需要补齐

149
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:43,815
just literally the number of messages that
are multiples of the block length is much

150
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:43,815
原因是长度为分组倍数的信息数

151
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:48,510
smaller than the total number of messages
that need not be a multiple of the block

152
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:48,510
比长度不必是分组倍数的信息数目少得多

153
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,853
length. And as a result we can't have a
one to one function from this bigger

154
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,853
因此我们不能获得一个从大的所有信息的集合

155
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,986
set of all messages to the smaller set of
messages which are a multiple of

156
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,986
到小的分组倍数长的信息集合的一一映射

157
00:05:56,986 --> 00:06:01,013
the block length. There will always be cases
where we have to extend the original

158
00:05:56,986 --> 00:06:01,013
总会有我们必须扩展原信息的情况

159
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:05,040
message and in this case that would
correspond to adding this dummy padding

160
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:05,040
这种情况就对应于加假的补齐分组

161
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,279
block. However, there is a very clever
idea called CMAC which shows that using a

162
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,279
但是 有一个非常聪明的方法叫CMAC

163
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,639
randomized padding function we can avoid
having to ever add a dummy block. And so

164
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,639
可以使用一个随机的补齐函数 不用加假分组了

165
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,353
let me explain how CMAC works. So CMAC
actually uses three keys. And, in fact,

166
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,353
我来解释一下CMAC如何工作 CMAC使用了三个密钥

167
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:22,941
sometimes this is called a three key
construction. So this first key, K, is

168
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:22,941
事实上这叫做三密钥机制 第一个密钥K

169
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:27,654
used in the CBC, the standard CBC MAC
algorithm. And then the keys, K1 and K2,

170
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:27,654
用于CBC计算 标准的CBC-MAC算法 然后密钥k1和k2

171
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:32,815
are used just for the padding scheme at
the very, very last block. And in fact in

172
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:32,815
仅用于补齐最后一个分组

173
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:38,479
the CMAC standard, the keys K1, K2 are
derived from the key K by some sort of a

174
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:38,479
事实上在CMAC标准中 密钥k1和k2是由密钥k推出的

175
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,834
pseudo random generator. So the way CMAC
works is as follows. Well, if the message

176
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,834
使用某种伪随机数发生器 CMAC如下工作

177
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:48,960
happens to not be a multiple of a block
length, then we append the ISO padding to

178
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:48,960
如果信息长度正好是分组长度的整数倍 那么我们采用ISO补齐方法

179
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,022
it. But then we also XOR this last
block with a secret key, K1, that the

180
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,022
但我们还要把这最后一个分组和密钥k1异或

181
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:58,560
adversary doesn't know. However, if the
message is a multiple of the block length,

182
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:58,560
攻击者不知道k1 但是如果信息长度是分组长度的倍数

183
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,872
then of course, we don't append anything
to it. But we XOR it with a different

184
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,872
那么当然 我们不做扩展 而是与另一密钥k2异或

185
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:06,692
key, K2, that, again, the adversary
doesn't actually know. So it turns out,

186
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:06,692
攻击者也不知道k2

187
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:11,276
just by doing that, it's now impossible to
apply the extension attacks that we could

188
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:11,276
这样做的话 不可能实施对级联函数、原CBC所适用的扩展攻击

189
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:14,933
do on the cascade function, and on
raw CBC. Because the poor

190
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:14,933
因为可怜的攻击者

191
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:18,971
adversary actually doesn't know what is
the last block that went into the

192
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:18,971
不知道最后分组运行了哪个函数

193
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,900
function. He doesn't know K1, and therefore,
he doesn't know the value at this

194
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,900
他不知道k1 因此他不知道这个点的值

195
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,103
particular point and as a result, he can't do
an extension attack. In fact, this is a

196
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,103
所以他无法实施扩展攻击 事实上

197
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:32,158
provable statement. And so that this
construction here is simply by XOR-ing

198
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:32,158
这个命题可以证明 这个机制就是简单地

199
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:36,441
K1 or XOR-ing K2 is really a PRF.
Despite not having to do a final

200
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:36,441
异或k1或是异或k2 是个PRF 尽管不需要做原CBC函数后面的

201
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:40,327
最终加密步骤 那么这是一个好处

202
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:40,327
encryption step after the raw CBC
function is computed. So, that's one

203
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,768
没有最终加密 那么好处是

204
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,768
benefit, that there's no final encryption
step. And the second benefit is that we resolve

205
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:49,430
我们解决了“是否发生了补齐”所带来的歧义

206
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:49,430
this ambiguity between whether padding did
happen or padding didn't happen by using

207
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,149
通过使用两个密钥来区分 “信息长度是分组长度的倍数”

208
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,149
two different keys to distinguish the case
that the message is a multiple of the block

209
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,761
与信息长度不是分组长度的倍数 而我们补齐了这两种情况

210
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,761
length versus the case where it's not but
we have a pad appended to the message. So

211
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:03,099
两个不同的密钥解决了两种情况之间的歧义

212
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:03,099
the two distinct keys resolve this
ambiguity between the two cases, and as a

213
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,866
因此这个补齐是充分安全的 所以如我所说

214
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,866
result, this padding actually is
sufficiently secure. And as I said,

215
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:11,660
CMAC有一个漂亮的定理告诉我们

216
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:11,660
there's actually a nice security theorem
that goes with CMAC that shows that the

217
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,884
CMAC机制是一个伪随机函数 具有与

218
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,884
CMAC construction really is a pseudo-random
function, with the same security

219
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:20,438
CBC-MAC相同的安全性 那么我想提醒一下

220
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:20,438
properties as CBC-MAC. So I wanted to
mention that CMAC is a federal standard

221
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:24,864
CMAC是NIST标准化的联邦标准 如果大家最近想用CBC-MAC

222
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:24,864
standardized by NIST and if you now, these
days, wanted to use a CBC-MAC for

223
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:29,373
还是去用CMAC吧 作为标准方法

224
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:29,373
anything, you would actually be using CMAC
as the standard way to do it. But

225
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:34,290
特别是在CMAC中 底层函数是AES

226
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:34,290
particularly in CMAC, the underlying block
cypher is AES and that gives us a secure

227
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,261
可以给我们一个由AES推出的安全的CBC-MAC
本节完结 下节我们讨论

228
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,261
CBC-MAC derived from AES. So that's the end
on the segment and in the next segment

229
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:39,549
一个并行的MAC机制

230
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:39,549
we'll talk about a parallel MAC.
