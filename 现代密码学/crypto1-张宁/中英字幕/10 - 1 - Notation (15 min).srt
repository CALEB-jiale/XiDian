1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,078
In the last module we saw that number
theory can be useful for key exchange.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,078
上节我们学过数论对密钥交换是非常有用的

3
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:08,471
In this modlule we will review some basic facts
of number theory that will help us build

4
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:08,471
而本节我们会复习对构建公钥系统有用的一些

5
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:12,759
many public key systems next week. As we
go through the material in this module it

6
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:12,759
基础知识 当我们学习本节的材料时

7
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,047
might help to pause the video from time to
time to make sure all the examples are clear

8
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,047
时不时地暂停本视频可能对更好地学习例子有帮助

9
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:21,283
So as I said we're gonna use number
theory to build key exchange protocols.

10
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:21,283
前面说过 数论有助于构建密钥交换协议

11
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:26,836
We're gonna use number theory to build
digital signatures, public encryption and many, many other things.

12
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:26,836
所以可以利用数论构建数字签名 公钥加密和许多其它的应用

13
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:29,676
But before we can
do all that, we have to review some basic

14
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:29,676
但首先我们必须复习一些数论的

15
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:33,855
facts from number theory and in fact in
this module we're gonna do a quick course

16
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:33,855
基础知识 而且本节将会对相关的概念做简单讲解

17
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:38,034
on the relevant concept. If you'd like to
review some of the material discussed in

18
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:38,034
但如果你想要课下复习本节讨论的知识

19
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:41,958
this module offline, I referenced at the
end of the module a free textbook by

20
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:41,958
我会在本节最后介绍一本由Victor Shoup所著的免费教科书

21
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,932
Victor Shoup and I pointed to some
specific chapters in his book that will

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,932
并且我会标出这本书中一些特别的章节 这样可能会

23
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:50,897
explain the materials that we will cover
here. So from here on I'm going to use the

24
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:50,897
更好地说明本节所讲的知识  从这里开始我会使用

25
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:55,832
following notation. I'm going to use
capital N to always denote a positive

26
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:55,832
一些符号 首先使用大写N标记一个正整数

27
00:00:55,832 --> 00:01:01,368
integer, and I'm going to use lower case p
to always denote a positive prime number.

28
00:00:55,832 --> 00:01:01,368
然后使用小写p标记一正素数

29
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:06,503
Now I'd like to introduce the following
notation, there's this funny Z that's

30
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:06,503
此外我还要介绍接下来的这个Z符号

31
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:12,172
written like two diagonal lines here with
a subscript N I'm gonna use that to denote

32
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:12,172
它写作两条对角线并附带一个下标N 我用它来表示

33
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:16,939
the sets as zero, one, two, up to N minus
one. This is actually a very common

34
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:16,939
由0-（N-1）的一组数 它在密码学中是非常

35
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:21,780
notation that's used in Crypto, and so
I'll stick to that here. So again, Z sub N

36
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:21,780
常见的符号 所以忠于密码学中的表示 再次强调

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,865
denotes the set of integers 0,1 up to N-1. And in fact, this is not just a

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,865
Z带下标N表示一组由0-（N-1）的整数 但事实上 它不仅仅表示

39
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:31,890
set of integers. We can do addition and
multiplication in this set as long as we

40
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:31,890
一组整数 还可以在这组整数中做加法与乘法 只要

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,991
always multiply module of the number N.
For those of you who know a little bit of

42
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,991
我们乘以模数N 而对于了解一点代数的同学

43
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,853
algebra, I'll just say that Z sub N
denotes a ring where addition and

44
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,853
Z带下标N可以代表乘法与加法均在

45
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:45,388
multiplication are done modulo N. This is
very common notation in crypto, although

46
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:45,388
模N条件下的环 这是个在密码学中非常常见的符号

47
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:49,922
in modern mathematics Z sub N sometimes
denotes something else. But as I said I'm

48
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:49,922
但现代数学中Z带下标N有时表示其它的东西 但出于忠于密码学的表示

49
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:54,568
gonna keep on using Z sub N to denote the
set of integers 0 to N-1 with

50
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:54,568
这里Z带下标N表示加法与乘法均在模N条件下的

51
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:59,230
addition and multiplication modulo N. So
I want to make sure everybody's

52
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:59,230
由0-（N-1）的整数组 所以我需要每个人

53
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,551
comfortable with modular arithmetic. And
so let's just look at the number, say, N=12

54
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,551
都熟悉模运算 这里举个例子 假设N=12

55
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:09,612
And let's just see some basic facts about modular arithmetic. So

56
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:09,612
然后通过该例了解模运算的基础知识

57
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:14,348
I'm gonna say that nine plus eight is
seventeen; seventeen is five modulo

58
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:14,348
首先9+8=17 而17≡5 mod 12

59
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:19,962
twelve, so I'm gonna write that nine plus
eight is equal to five in Z 12. Now

60
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:19,962
所以这里表示为Z12中9+8=5

61
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:26,866
can someone tell me how much is five times
seven in Z12? In other words, how much is modular 12?

62
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:26,866
然后有人可以告诉我在Z12中5*7等于多少？ 换言之 5*7模12等于多少？

63
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:33,660
Well, five times seven is 35. And if you recall, 36 is divisible by 12

64
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:33,660
当然5*7=35 而36可被12整除

65
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,805
So five times seven is really -1 module of 12. 35 is minus

66
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,805
所以5*7≡-1mod 12 且35等于-1模12

67
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:44,491
one module of twelve. But minus one module
of 12 is basically the same as 11,

68
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:44,491
但-1模12与11相同

69
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:49,975
cuz I just add 12  to -1 and I
get 11. And the next question is, how

70
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:49,975
因为12+（-1）=11 接下来的问题是

71
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:56,189
much is 5 - 7 seven in the Z12?
Well, 5-7 is -2.

72
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:56,189
Z12中5-7等于多少？ 当然5-7=-2

73
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,828
-2 modulo 12, well, I just add 12
to -2 and I get 10. As a result,

74
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,828
而-2 mod 12 当然只需在-2上加12 得到10 所以

75
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:07,815
we say that 5 - 7 is equal to
10. So again, this is just to make sure

76
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:07,815
结果就是 5-7≡10 mod 12 上面这个例子只是为了确保

77
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:13,848
everybody is comfortable with this notation of working
in Z12. In other words, working in modulo 12.

78
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:13,848
每位同学都熟悉Z12中的符号 换言之 就是模12运算

79
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:18,856
Now, I'd just like to make a
general statement that, in fact,

80
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:18,856
现在 有一点需要注意

81
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:23,034
arithmetic in ZN, in other words,
arithmetic modulo N works just as you

82
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:23,034
ZN中的运算 换言之 就是模N运算的运算方法与你们以前学过的一样

83
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:27,268
would expect. So, for example, all the
laws that you know about addition and

84
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:27,268
例如 你们了解的加法乘法法则

85
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:31,847
multiplication work equally well in ZN.
For example, the distributive law, X times

86
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:31,847
同样适用于ZN 如 分配律 X*（Y+Z）

87
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:36,196
Y plus Z, is still gonna be equal to X
times Y plus X times Z. So many of the

88
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:36,196
同样等于X*Y+X*Z 所以你们

89
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:41,003
things that you know about arithmetic when
working over the integers or in the reals,

90
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:41,003
了解的很多整数 实数中的运算法则

91
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:46,247
will translate to working in, ZN, namely
working modulo N.

92
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:46,247
都可以转化成ZN中的运算 也就是模N运算

93
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:51,965
So the next concept we need is what's called a greatest common
divisor, or a GCD. And so suppose they

94
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:51,965
然后接下来的概念是最大公约数 即GCD 假设

95
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:57,319
give you two integers X and Y. We say that
the GCD of X and Y is basically the

96
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:57,319
给定整数X与Y X与Y的最大公约数就是

97
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,880
greatest common divisor it's the largest
number, the largest integer that divides

98
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,880
公约数的最大值 就是能够整除X与Y的最大整值

99
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,138
both X and Y. So for example, what is the
GCD of 12 and 18?

100
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,138
例如 12与18的最大公约数是？

101
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,258
Well the GCD is 6, because 6 divides both 12
and 18,

102
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,258
当然这个数是6 因为6可以同时被12与18除尽

103
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:18,965
and it's the largest number that divides both 12 and 18.

104
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:18,965
而且它是能够被12与18除尽的最大的整数

105
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:27,245
Now
there is an important fact about GCD's in particular, if I give you two numbers, two
integers X and Y, there will always exist

106
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:27,245
然后有一个关于GCD的重要特征 如果给定两个整数X与Y 则一定存在

107
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:32,711
two other integers, I will call them A and
B, such that if I look at a times X + B

108
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:32,711
另外两个整数 a与b 并且有a*X+b*Y与

109
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:38,177
times Y what I get is the GCD of X and Y.
In other words the GCD of X and Y is a

110
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:38,177
所求的X与Y的GCD相同 换言之 X与Y的GCD

111
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:43,711
linear combination of X and Y using the
integers A and B. So far let us look at a

112
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:43,711
用整数a与b求得的X与Y的线性组合 让我们看一个例子

113
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:49,245
simple example, here, let's look at the
GCD from before, so the integers for the

114
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:49,245
例如前面举过的这个例子 所以要求得GCD所需的整数是

115
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:55,831
GCD would be 2 times 12 Minus 1
times 18. That's 24 minus 18,

116
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:55,831
2*12-1*18 也就是24-18

117
00:04:55,831 --> 00:05:02,533
which is equal to 6. So the integers A
and B in this case would be 2 and -1

118
00:04:55,831 --> 00:05:02,533
等于6 所以这里的a与b就是2与-1

119
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:08,625
But this is just an example, and in
fact, these integers, A and B will exist

120
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:08,625
这里是举的一个特例 事实上 对任意整数X与Y

121
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:13,463
for any integers, X and Y. Now not only do
A and B exist, in fact there's a very

122
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:13,463
都存在整数a与b 而且事实上有一种

123
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:17,838
simple and efficient algorithm to find
these integers, to find A and B. The

124
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:17,838
非常简便有效的计算这两个整数a与b的方法

125
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:22,627
algorithm is what's called the extended
Euclidean algorithm. This is actually one

126
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:22,627
这个算法叫做扩展Euclid算法 它是

127
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:27,416
of the prettiest algorithms from ancient
Greek times, due to Euclid of course. I'm

128
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:27,416
古希腊时期非常好的算法之一 当然由Euclid提出

129
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,672
not gonna show you how this algorithm
works here, I. It's a fairly simple

130
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,672
这里我不会说明该算法的工作方式 它只是个很简单的算法

131
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:36,343
algorithm. I'll just tell that in fact
given X and Y, this algorithm will find A

132
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:36,343
但需要说明的是 给定X与Y 该算法会在

133
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:40,942
and B in time roughly quadratic in the
logarithms of X and Y. We'll come back to

134
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:40,942
大约计算X与Y的对数的二次方倍的时间内找到a与b

135
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:44,966
that and discuss the, the performance of
Euclid's algorithm I have a bit more

136
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:44,966
之后 我们返回到这里并讨论Euclid算法 而且我会补充

137
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:49,752
detail in just a minute. But, for now all
we need to know is that A and B can

138
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:49,752
一些细节 但现在我们需要知道是确实有方法可以有效地

139
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:55,719
actually be found efficiently. Now, if the
GCD of X and Y happens to be 1. In other

140
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:55,719
找出整数a与b  如果X与Y的GCD值正好是1

141
00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:00,956
words, 1 is the largest integer that
divides both X and Y, then we say that X

142
00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:00,956
换句话说 1是X与Y的公约数中的最大值 那么就称

143
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:05,926
and Y are relatively prime. For example,
the GCD of three and five, it's not

144
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:05,926
X与Y互素 例如 gcd(3,5) 不难发现

145
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:11,567
difficult to see that it hap, that happens
to be 1, Because both 3 and 5 are

146
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:11,567
这个值正好是1 因为3与5都是素数

147
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:15,688
prime. The next topic we need to talk
about is modulated inversion. So other

148
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:15,688
接下来我们要讨论的是模逆运算

149
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:20,214
than rationals we know what the inverse of
a number is. In other words if I give you

150
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:20,214
不同于我们知道的有理数的逆 也就是说 如果给定

151
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:24,130
the number 2 the inverse of 2 is
simply the fraction one half.

152
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:24,130
一个数2 那么它的逆就是分数1／2

153
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,111
the qestion is what about inverses when we, we
work module N. Well, so the inverse of

154
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,111
而这里的问题如何在模N的条件下找数的逆 这里

155
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:37,475
an element X in Z N is simply another
element Y in Z N such that X times Y is

156
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:37,475
ZN中的元素X的逆应该是ZN中另一个元素Y 且X*Y

157
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:43,650
equal to 1 in Z N. In other words X
times Y is equal to 1 modulo N. And this

158
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:43,650
在ZN中等于1 换言之 X*Y≡1mod N 那么这个

159
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,066
number Y is denoted by X inverse. And it's
not difficult to see that if, if Y exists,

160
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,066
数Y就是X的模逆 不难发现 如果Y存在

161
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:54,351
then in fact it's unique. And as I said,
we'll use X inverse to denote the inverse

162
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:54,351
那么它也就是唯一的 这里我们用X＾-1表示X的逆

163
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:59,440
of X. So let's look at a quick example.
Suppose N is some odd integer, and I ask

164
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:59,440
举个例子 假设N是奇整数 待求

165
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,636
you what is the inverse of 2 in ZN?
So it's not too difficult to see that the

166
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,636
2在ZN中的逆 不难发现

167
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:09,810
inverse of two in ZN in fact is N plus one
over 2 and you can see that this is an

168
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:09,810
2在ZN中的逆应该是N+1／2 不难发现它是一个整数

169
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,429
integer because N is odd, therefore, N+1 is even and, therefore, (N+1)/2

170
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,429
因为N为奇数 因此N+1是偶数 所以(N+1)/2

171
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:19,542
is in fact an integer and the
range 1..N as required. Now why is (N+1)/2

172
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:19,542
是整数且在范围1-N中 然后为什么是(N+1)/2

173
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:24,407
the inverse of two?
Well, let's just multiply the 2 so we do

174
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:24,407
我们将其乘以2,

175
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:29,273
2 times (N+1) over 2 and what do
we get? Well, that's simply equal to N+1

176
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:29,273
计算2乘以(N+1)/2会得到什么？很简单,等于N+1，

177
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:34,508
and N+1 is simply equal to
1 in ZN. So since their product is equal

178
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:34,508
而N+1在ZN中等于1。因此，由它们的乘积为1，

179
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:38,889
to 1. We know that (N+1)/2
is the inverse of 2 in ZN.

180
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:38,889
得到(N+1)/2是ZN中2的逆。

181
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,174
Now we understand what a modular inverse is, the
question is which elements actually have

182
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,174
现在我们知道了什么是模逆，问题是ZN中哪些元素有逆呢？

183
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:48,853
an inverse in ZN? And so there's a very
simple lemma that says that if for an

184
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:48,853
有一个简单的引理表明：若ZN中的一个元素X可逆，

185
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:53,911
element X in ZN, that element has
an inverse if and only if it is relatively

186
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:53,911
（条件是）当且仅当

187
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:58,500
prime to the modulus N, to the number N.
So I'll say that again. X and ZN is

188
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:58,500
它与模N互质，和N互质。我再说一遍，

189
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,607
invertible if and only if X is relatively
prime to N. And let's quickly prove that.

190
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,607
当且仅当X与N互质时，X和ZN可逆。我们快速地证明一下，

191
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:08,403
It's actually fairly simple to see. So
suppose a GCD of X and N happens to be

192
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:08,403
这相当简单。假设X和N的GCD恰好等于1，

193
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:13,262
equal to one. So X is relatively prime to
N. Well, by this property of GCD as we

194
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:13,262
即X与N互质。由已知的GCD的性质，

195
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:18,120
know that there exists integers A and B.
Such that A times X plus B times N is

196
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:18,120
存在整数A和B，使得A*X+B*N

197
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,469
equal to the GCD of X and N, which happens
to be one. So A times X plus B times N is

198
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,469
等于X和N的GCD，也就是1。所以，A*X+B*N等于1。

199
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:28,778
equal to 1. Now we can actually take
this equation here and, and us it reduce

200
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:28,778
现在我们把这个等式记录在这，然后简化它的模N运算。

201
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:34,360
it's modulo N. So what this means is that
a times X is equal to one in Z, N. Once we

202
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:34,360
这就是说a*X在ZN中等于1。

203
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,669
reduce this equation modulo N this term
simply falls off because B times N is

204
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,669
最后我们可以把这个取模等式减少这项是因为B*N可以被N整除，

205
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:46,059
divisible by N and therefore is 0
modulo N. But what we just showed is that

206
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:46,059
对N取模运算结果为0。我们刚才证明了

207
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:52,763
in fact X inverse is simply A in ZN. So
because X is relatively prime to N, we

208
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:52,763
X的逆是ZN中的A。因此，已知X与N互质，

209
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:58,700
were able to show that X is invertible by
actually building the inverse of X modulo N

210
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:58,700
可通过求X mod N 的逆证明X是可逆的。

211
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,349
Now what about the other direction?
What happens if the GCD is greater than 1?

212
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,349
换一个方向呢？如果GCD大于1会怎么样？

213
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:08,339
Then we want to show that there is no
inverse. But that's actually very easy to

214
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:08,339
我们想证明无逆存在，而这其实很容易证明。

215
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,908
see because in this case, if you claim
that A happens to be the inverse of X

216
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,908
因为在这种情况下，假设A是X模N的逆，

217
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:17,658
modulo N, well, let's look at a<i>x; a<i>X we know should be equal to 1 modulo N</i></i>

218
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:17,658
考察a*x，a*x应该等于 1 mod N，

219
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:22,467
But if the GCD(X,N) is
bigger than 1, then the GCD(a<i>X,N)</i>

220
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:22,467
但如果 GCD(X,N)大于1，GCD(a*X,N) 也会大于1。

221
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:27,157
is bigger than one. But, if the GCD
of A times X and N is bigger than 1,

222
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:27,157
而如果GCD(a*X,N)大于1，

223
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:32,366
then it's not possible that A<i>X is
equal to 1. So A<i>X must also be</i></i>

224
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:32,366
那么 A*X 就不可能等于1，而是一定比1大。

225
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:38,436
bigger than 1, and therefore, A cannot
be the inverse of X module N.

226
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:38,436
因此，A不可能是X mod N 的逆。

227
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:42,602
So this proves that, in fact, in, when the GCD is
greater than 1, X cannot have an

228
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:42,602
至此，证明了GCD大于1时，X没有逆。

229
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:47,282
inverse, because there is no A, such that
A times X is equal to one modulo N

230
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:47,282
因为不存在A满足A*X等于 1 mod N 。

231
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:51,791
And this might be a bit confusing, so you
might be best just to, do an example. So

232
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:51,791
这可能有点令人费解，所以最好举个例子。

233
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,451
let's look at, let's suppose that the GCD
of X and N happens to be equal to 2.

234
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,451
于是，我们假设X和N的GCD恰好是2，

235
00:09:56,451 --> 00:10:01,843
I claim that X is therefore, is not
invertible modular N. Well, why is that

236
00:09:56,451 --> 00:10:01,843
那么，X在ZN中不可逆。为什么呢？

237
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:07,615
true? Well, for all A, we know that A
times X is gonna be even, is even. And the

238
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:07,615
我们知道对任意的A，A*X为偶数。

239
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:13,471
reason we know that is because, well, 2
divides X and 2 divides N. Well, since

240
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:13,471
因为2能整除X，也能整除N。

241
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:18,501
two divide X, 2 is also gonna divide A
times X. And therefore, A times X must be

242
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:18,501
若2能整除X，那么2也能整除A*X，无疑，A*X必是偶数。

243
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:23,468
even. But what that means is that there's
no way that A times X is equal to 1 modulo N

244
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:23,468
这说明A*X不可能等于 1 mod N 。

245
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:28,649
In particular, there's no way
that A times X is equal to B times N + 1

246
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:28,649
特别地，A*X不可能等于B*（N+1)。

247
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,749
This simply can't happen, this
equality must not hold. Because this side

248
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,749
A*X=B*(N+1)不成立，不然等式两边不相等。因为一边

249
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:39,257
happens to be even, as we said. B times N
for exactly the same reason is also even:

250
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:39,257
刚好如我们所说是偶数，同理，B*N也是偶数：

251
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:44,832
N is divisible by two; therefore B times N
is also divisible by two. So therefore B

252
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:44,832
N能被2整除，所以B*N也能被2整除，所以

253
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:50,340
times N+1 is odd. And since even
can't equal to odd, it's not possible that

254
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:50,340
B*(N+1)是奇数。因为偶数不可能等于奇数，所以

255
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,297
A times X is equal to some multiple of N+1. And in particular this means

256
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,297
A*X与N+1的倍数不相等。这表明：

257
00:10:56,297 --> 00:11:01,331
that A cannot be the inverse of X because
A times X cannot be 1 mod N so X is not

258
00:10:56,297 --> 00:11:01,331
A不可能是X的逆，因为A*X不等于 1 mod N，因此，X在模N情况下

259
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:05,308
invertible modular N. So now we have a
complete understanding of what are the

260
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:05,308
不是可逆的。现在我们完全理解了什么是可逆元素。

261
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:09,192
invertible elements. Basically, we know
that an element is invertible if and only

262
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:09,192
基本上，我们知道了：当且仅当一个元素与N互质时该元素可逆。

263
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:13,270
if it's relatively prime to N. And what I
like about this proof is I would say this

264
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:13,270
这个证明让我喜欢的地方，我愿意称其为

265
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,623
is what's called a computer-science proof
In the sense that not only does it prove

266
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,623
计算机科学证明。从某种意义上说，它不仅证明了

267
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:22,250
to you that the inverse exists; it also
shows you how to efficiently calculate the

268
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:22,250
可逆解的存在性，同时证明了如何有效计算逆运算的结果。

269
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,312
inverse. And the way we calculate the
inverse, is basically by using this

270
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,312
而计算逆运算的结果的方法基于

271
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:30,826
extending decreasing algorithm. Define the
numbers A and B. And once we found the

272
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:30,826
扩展递减算法。定义数字A和B，一旦我们算出A和B，

273
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:35,453
numbers A and B, we done because A is the
inverse of X. And the numbers A and B can

274
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:35,453
计算就完成了，因为A是X的逆，而且可以高效地

275
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:41,269
be found very efficiently. So along the
way I've also shown you an algorithm for

276
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:41,269
计算出数字A和B。所以在证明过程中我已经告诉了你们计算

277
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,768
inverting elements, modulo N.

278
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,768
模N的元素的逆的算法。

279
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:53,243
Okay. So bear with me, and let's introduce this little more notation. 
So we're gonna denote by ZN as the set of invertible elements in

280
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:53,243
OK.坚持一下，再介绍一个符号。我们用ZN*表示ZN中可逆元素的集合。

281
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:58,439
Z N. In other words, ZN is the set
of all elements in ZN such that GCD(X,N)=1

282
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:58,439
换句话说，ZN*是ZN中满足GCD(X,N)=1的元素的集合。

283
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,930
Okay. But I want you, again, to think of ZN as

284
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,930
OK.再一次，我希望你们只是把ZN*看成

285
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,736
basically those elements in ZN that have
an inverse. So let's look at a few

286
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,736
ZN中逆存在的元素的集合。下面，我们来看几个例子。

287
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:12,859
examples. So let's start with a prime p.
We know that of the integers from zero to

288
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:12,859
首先，质数p。众所周知，所有从0到p-1

289
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:17,350
p-1, all of them are gonna be
relatively primed to p except one

290
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:17,350
的整数都和p互质，除了一个

291
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,409
integer--namely, the integer 0. Zero is
not relatively primed to P, because the

292
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,409
整数――0。0和p不互质，因为

293
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:27,719
GCD(p,0)=0, not 1. So
therefore, if p is a prime, the set ZP

294
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:27,719
GCD(p,0)=0，不等于1，因此，若p为质数，集合ZP*

295
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:34,196
is simply ZP minus 0, Which means
that everything in Z<u>P is invertible</u>

296
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:34,196
就是ZP减去0，也就是说，除0外，ZP中的所有元素都是可逆的。

297
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:41,093
except for 0. So if you like the size
of ZP<i>, it's simply P-1. Now</i>

298
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:41,093
如果你想知道ZP*的大小，很简单，就是p-1。接下来，

299
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:46,230
let's look at our favorite integer again.
So why don't you tell me what is Z12

300
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:46,230
再看看我们最喜欢的整数。为什么不告诉我Z12，

301
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,036
what is the set of invertible elements modulo 12?

302
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,036
Z12可逆元素的集合是什么？

303
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:57,226
And the answer, of course, is all the numbers
that are relatively primed to 12--namely,

304
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:57,226
当然，答案就是所有和12互质的数字，即

305
00:12:57,226 --> 00:13:01,839
1, 5, 7, and 11. So, for
example, 3, 4, 6--all of those are

306
00:12:57,226 --> 00:13:01,839
1,5,7和11。其他数字如3,4,6――他们都不是可逆的

307
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,802
not invertible because they all have a, a
non-trivial GCD with twelve, And as we

308
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,802
因为他们都和12有一个大于1的GCD。

309
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:11,085
said before, if I give you an element X
and ZN<i>, you can find its inverse</i>

310
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:11,085
如前所述，给定元素X和ZN，可通过扩展Euclid算法

311
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:15,476
using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
You can find its inverse very efficiently,

312
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:15,476
算出X的逆，实际上，用这种算法

313
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:19,760
in fact, using this algorithm. So what we
just learned is basically how to solve

314
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:19,760
计算很高效。所以，我们刚才学习的只是怎样解

315
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,205
modular linear equations. In other words,
if I give you a linear equation and I ask

316
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,205
模数线性方程。换句话说，如果给定一个线性方程，

317
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:28,543
you to solve it mod N, it's actually very
easy to do. All you do is you move B to

318
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:28,543
求解并对N取模是很简单的：只需要将B移到另一边，

319
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:32,826
the other side so you have a minus B, and
then you multiply by A inverse. So the

320
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:32,826
得到-B，然后乘以A的逆。

321
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:37,217
answer is minus B times A inverse. And you
can find A inverse using the Euclidean

322
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:37,217
答案就是(-B)*A^(-1),可以利用扩展Euclid算法计算A的逆。

323
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:41,585
algorithm. And once you have a inverse,
you'd simply multiply it by minus B,

324
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:41,585
一旦算出了逆，将其乘以-B，

325
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:46,188
modulo N, and that gives you the solution
to this linear equation. Now the

326
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:46,188
mod N,就得到了线性方程的解。

327
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:51,149
Euclidian algorithm actually takes time
that's quadratic in logarithm of N. So it

328
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:51,149
Euclid算法实际花费时间是N的对数的平方，所以

329
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,690
takes time proportional to log squared N.
And as a result we say that this is a

330
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,690
它花费的时间和logN的平方成比例，因此，我们称这是一个

331
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,980
quadratic algorithm for solving linear
equations, modulo N, and if fact this is

332
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,980
解线性方程的二次算法，mod N，而且，这也是

333
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,876
the best know algorithm. And so if you
think back to your high-school algebra

334
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,876
最广为人知的算法。回想高中代数，

335
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:08,692
days, after you learned how to solve
linear equations, the next question was,

336
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:08,692
在学习解线性方程之后，接下来的问题是，

337
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:12,305
well, what about quadratic equations. And
that problem is actually quite

338
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:12,305
如何解二次方程。这个问题很有趣，

339
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:15,460
interesting, and we're gonna see that in
the next few segments.

340
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:15,460
在接下来的几节，我们来看看怎么解决这个问题。
