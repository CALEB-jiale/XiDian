1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,951
在开始学习这门课程前,我要给你们快速讲一下

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,951
Before we start with the technical
material, I wanna give you a quick

3
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:06,487
密码学的简要概述，以及密码学的不同领域。

4
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:06,487
overview of what cryptography is about and
the different areas of cryptography. So

5
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:10,487
密码学的核心当然是安全通信，他本质上

6
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:10,487
the core of cryptography of course is
secure communication that essentially

7
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:14,539
由两部分组成。第一部分是安全秘钥的建立，然后是

8
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:14,539
consists of two parts. The first is
secured key establishment and then how do

9
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,697
利用共享秘钥进行安全通信。我们说过

10
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,697
we communicate securely once we have a
shared key. We already said that secured

11
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:22,854
安全秘钥的建立是指Alice和Bob互相通信

12
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:22,854
key establishment essentially amounts to
Alice and Bob sending messages to one

13
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:26,906
这样在协议的最后，双方达成共享秘钥k

14
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:26,906
another such that at the end of this
protocol, there's a shared key that they

15
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:30,906
除了共享秘钥，事实上

16
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:30,906
both agree on, shared key K, and beyond
that, beyond just a shared key, in fact

17
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:35,274
Alice应该知道她在和Bob通信同样Bob应该知道他在和Alice通信

18
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:35,274
Alice would know that she's talking to Bob
and Bob would know that he's talking to

19
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:39,964
但是弱的攻击者监听该对话却无法得知

20
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:39,964
Alice. But a poor attacker who listens in
on this conversation has no idea what the

21
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:44,011
共享秘钥，本讲稍后我们来看怎样操作。现在

22
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:44,011
shared key is. And we'll see how to do
that later on in the course. Now once they

23
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:47,657
他们一旦达成共享秘钥，他们希望使用该秘钥安全地交换信息

24
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:47,657
have a shared key, they want exchange
messages securely using this key, and

25
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:51,698
我们将会讨论满足他们的加密机制，这样就使得

26
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:51,698
we'll talk about encryption schemes that
allow them to do that in such a way that

27
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:55,491
攻击者无法知道什么消息在被传来传去。

28
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:55,491
an attacker can't figure out what messages
are being sent back and forth. And

29
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:59,630
进一步说，攻击者甚至无法篡改通信内容，一旦篡改，立刻被检测到

30
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:59,630
furthermore an attacker cannot even tamper
with this traffic without being detected.

31
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,227
换句话说，加密机制提供了机密性和

32
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,227
In other words, these encryption schemes
provide both confidentiality and

33
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:06,774
完整性。不过密码学的功能远不止这两点。

34
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:06,774
integrity. But cryptography does much,
much, much more than just these two

35
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:10,519
我来给你举一些例子。第一个例子

36
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:10,519
things. And I want to give you a few
examples of that. So the first example I

37
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,468
叫做数字签名。数字签名

38
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,468
want to give you is what's called a
digital signature. So a digital signature,

39
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:18,892
基本上与实际手写签名类似，在实际中

40
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:18,892
basically, is the analog of the signature
in the physical world. In the physical

41
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:23,372
当你签署一份文件时，你在文件上写下你签名

42
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:23,372
world, remember when you sign a document,
essentially, you write your signature on

43
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:27,740
你的签名总是一样的。你总是在所有的文件上

44
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:27,740
that document and your signature is always
the same. You always write the same

45
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,164
签同样的字，在数字世界中，

46
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,164
signature on all documents that you wanna
sign. In the digital world, this can't

47
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:36,812
签名不能这样因为一旦攻击者获得我的一个文件签名

48
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:36,812
possibly work because if the attacker just
obtained one signed document from me, he

49
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:41,180
他可以复制粘贴到别的我不想

50
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:41,180
can cut and paste my signature unto some
other document that I might not have

51
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,247
签字的文件上。所以在数字世界中，

52
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,247
wanted to sign. And so, it's simply not
possible in a digital world that my

53
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:49,590
我的签名对我想签的所有不同文件不可能一样。本门课的

54
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:49,590
signature is the same for all documents
that I want to sign. So we're gonna talk

55
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,830
后半部分我们将讨论如何构建数字签名

56
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,830
about how to construct digital signatures
in the second half of the course. It's

57
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,123
这是一个很有趣的部件，我们将确切地看到如何去做。

58
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,123
really quite an interesting primitive and
we'll see exactly how to do it. Just to

59
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:02,098
提示你一下，数字签名基本上就是

60
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:02,098
give you a hint, the way digital
signatures work is basically by making the

61
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:06,232
待签内容的一个函数值，因此，一个攻击者

62
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:06,232
digital signature via function of the
content being signed. So an attacker who

63
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:10,313
想要复制我的签名到其他文件上将无法成功

64
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:10,313
tries to copy my signature from one
document to another is not gonna succeed

65
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:14,541
因为，数字签名，新文件与旧文件的函数值不一致

66
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:14,541
because the signature. On the new document
is not gonna be the proper function of the

67
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,526
所以签名验证失败，就像我说过的

68
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,526
data in the new document, and as a result,
the signature won't verify. And as I said,

69
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:22,608
稍后我们将确切地看到如何构建数字签名构造

70
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:22,608
we're gonna see exactly how to construct
digital signatures later on and then we'll

71
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:27,193
并且我们会证明这些构造是安全的。我想说的密码学的

72
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:27,193
prove that those constructions are secure.
Another application of cryptography that I

73
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:31,096
另一个应用是匿名通信，想象一下

74
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:31,096
wanted to mention, is anonymous
communication. So, here, imagine user

75
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:35,828
用户Alice想和某个聊天服务器Bob说话，也许她想谈论病情

76
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:35,828
Alice wants to talk to some chat server,
Bob. And, perhaps she wants to talk about

77
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:40,382
所以她想匿名，从而聊天服务器

78
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:40,382
a medical condition, and so she wants to
do that anonymously, so that the chat

79
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:45,113
并不知道她是谁。有一个标准方法叫

80
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:45,113
server doesn't actually know who she is.
Well, there's a standard method, called a

81
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:49,946
mixnet，可以允许Alice通过公共互联网与Bob通信

82
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:49,946
mixnet, that allows Alice to communicate
over the public internet with Bob through

83
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:54,856
经过经过一系列代理，最终让Bob无从得知对方身份

84
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:54,856
a sequence of proxies such that at the end
of the communication Bob has no idea who he

85
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:59,537
mixnet的工作原理基本上是，当Alice给Bob发出信息

86
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:59,537
just talked to. The way mixnets work
is basically as Alice sends her messages

87
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:03,818
经过一系列代理时，信息被适当地加密 解密

88
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:03,818
to Bob through a sequence of proxies,
these messages get encrypted and

89
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,271
以至于Bob不知道通信对方身份而且代理们

90
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,271
decrypted appropriately so that Bob has no
idea who he talked to and the proxies

91
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,724
也不知道Alice在和Bob通信，或者压根不知道

92
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,724
themselves don't even know that Alice is
talking to Bob, or that actually who is

93
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:16,750
谁在和谁通信。匿名通信的一个有趣事实是

94
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:16,750
talking to whom more generally. One
interesting thing about this anonymous

95
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,498
它是双向的，换句话说

96
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,498
communication channel is, this is
bi-directional. In other words, even

97
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:24,743
尽管Bob不知道他在跟谁说话，他依然可以回应Alice

98
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:24,743
though Bob has no idea who he's talking
to, he can still respond to Alice and

99
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:29,153
Alice可以收到回复。一旦我们有了匿名通信

100
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:29,153
Alice will get those messages. Once we
have anonymous communication, we can build

101
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:33,784
我们可以建立其他隐私机制。我想为大家举个叫匿名

102
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:33,784
other privacy mechanisms. And I wanna give
you one example which is called anonymous

103
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:37,643
数字现金的例子。记得在现实中如果我有一美元

104
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:37,643
digital cash. Remember that in the
physical world if I have a physical

105
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:42,108
我可以去书店买本书，书店老板并不知道我是谁

106
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:42,108
dollar, I can walk into a bookstore and
buy a book and the merchant would have no

107
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:46,876
问题是我们能不能做同样的事情在数字世界里

108
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:46,876
idea who I am. The question is whether we
can do the exact same thing in the digital

109
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:50,963
在数字世界里，Alice可以有一个数字美元

110
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:50,963
world. In the digital world, basically,
Alice might have a digital dollar,

111
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:55,984
一个数字美元硬币。她可能想在网上购物花掉这一美元

112
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:55,984
a digital dollar coin. And she might wanna
spend that digital dollar at some online

113
00:03:55,984 --> 00:04:00,760
比如网上书店之类。现在我们要让Alice

114
00:03:55,984 --> 00:04:00,760
merchants, perhaps some online bookstore.
Now, what we'd like to do is make it so

115
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,539
在书店花掉这块硬币，而书店不知道

116
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,539
that when Alice spends her coin at the
bookstore, the bookstore would have no

117
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,629
Alice是谁。这样我们提供了与现实一样的匿名

118
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,629
idea who Alice is. So we provide the same
anonymity that we get from physical cash.

119
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:15,470
问题是在数字世界里，Alice使用的硬币

120
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:15,470
Now the problem is that in the digital
world, Alice can take the coin that she

121
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,250
她可以在花掉之前复制该硬币

122
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,250
had, this one dollar coin, and before she spent
it, she can actually make copies of it.

123
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,086
突然间姐不是一美元硬币了

124
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,086
And then all of a sudden instead of just
having just one dollar coin now all

125
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:27,936
她突然间就有了三美元硬币，它们当然是一样的

126
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:27,936
of a sudden she has three dollar coins and
they're all the same of course, and

127
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:31,828
没什么能阻止她复制硬币并花掉它。

128
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:31,828
there's nothing preventing her from taking
those replicas of a dollar coin and

129
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:35,819
那问题就是，我们该如何提供匿名数字现金

130
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:35,819
spending it at other merchants. And so the
question is how do we provide anonymous

131
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,849
同时还要防止Alice重复花费

132
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,849
digital cash? But at the same time, also
prevent Alice from double spending the

133
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:43,760
购买不同的商品。在某些情况下这里有矛盾

134
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:43,760
dollar coin at different merchants. In
some sense there's a paradox here where

135
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,879
安全和匿名是相悖的，因为我们有匿名现金

136
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,879
anonymity is in conflict with security
because if we have anonymous cash there's

137
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,999
将没有什么能阻止Alice重复花费

138
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,999
nothing to prevent Alice from double
spending the coin and because the coin is

139
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,244
因为硬币是匿名的，我们无法找到诈骗者。

140
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,244
anonymous we have no way of telling who
committed this fraud. And so the question

141
00:04:56,244 --> 00:05:00,394
那我们如何解决该问题呢？事实上，这是完全可行的

142
00:04:56,244 --> 00:05:00,394
is how do we resolve this tension. And it
turns out, it's completely doable. And

143
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:04,757
我们将会讨论到匿名数字现金。给大家点提示

144
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:04,757
we'll talk about anonymous digital cash
later on. Just to give you a hint, I'll

145
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:09,173
我们的方法是确保当Alice只花费一次时

146
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:09,173
say that the way we do it is basically by
making sure that if Alice spends the coin

147
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:13,764
没人知道她是谁。但如果她花费多于一次

148
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:13,764
once then no one knows who she is, but if
she spends the coin more than once, all of

149
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:17,878
她的个人信息将会突然全部暴露

150
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:17,878
a sudden, her identity is completely
exposed and then she could be subject to

151
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:22,096
她将面临各种法律问题。那就是匿名现金

152
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:22,096
all sorts of legal problems. And so that's
how anonymous digital cash would

153
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:26,158
从高层次来说如何工作的。本课稍后将介绍如何实现它

154
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:26,158
work at a high level and we'll see how to
implement it later on in the course.

155
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:30,219
密码学的另一应用是关于更多抽象的协议

156
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:30,219
Another application of cryptography has to
do with more abstract protocols, but

157
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:34,333
不过在我说一般结果之前，我想给大家看两个例子

158
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:34,333
before I speak the general result, I
want to give you two examples. So the

159
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,343
第一个例子与选举系统有关。这有个选举的问题

160
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,343
first example has to do with election
systems. So here's the election problem.

161
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:42,656
假设有两个党派，0和1，供选民投票

162
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:42,656
Suppose ... we have two parties, party zero
and party one. And voters vote for these

163
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:47,101
比如说，这个选民投给了0，那个投给了1，等等

164
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:47,101
parties. So for example, this voter could
have voted for party zero, this voter voted for

165
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:52,313
在本次选举中，0得三票，1得二票

166
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:52,313
party one. And so on. So in this election,
party zero got three votes and party two

167
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:56,590
0当然是本次选举的获胜者

168
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:56,590
got two votes. So the winner of the
election, of course, is party zero. But

169
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,579
但是更一般的，胜者是获得多数票的一方

170
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,579
more generally, the winner of the election
is the party who receives the majority of

171
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:06,453
现在，投票的问题如下，投票者

172
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:06,453
the votes. Now, the voting problem is the
following. The voters would somehow like

173
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:11,720
可能会计算多数投票结果，不过却不知道每个人的投票结果

174
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:11,720
to compute the majority of the votes, but
do it in such a way such that nothing else

175
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,797
明白了吗？那么问题来了，要怎么实现它?

176
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,797
is revealed about their individual votes.
Okay? So the question is how to do that?

177
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:21,493
为此我们引入了一个选举中心

178
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:21,493
And to do so, we're gonna introduce an
election center who's gonna help us

179
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:26,633
用来帮我们计算大多数票，但投票结果保密

180
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:26,633
compute the majority, but keep the votes
otherwise secret. And what the parties

181
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:32,027
各派将把他们的投票加密后送给选举中心

182
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:32,027
will do is they will each send the funny
encryption of their votes to the election

183
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:36,949
投票结束时，选举中心可以计算出胜者

184
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:36,949
center in such a way that at the end of
the election, the election center is able

185
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,615
但除了选举胜者之外

186
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,615
to compute and output the winner of the
election. However, other than the winner

187
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:46,580
各个投票结果无从知晓

188
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:46,580
of the election, nothing else is revealed
about the individual votes. The individual

189
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,366
个人投票是完全私密的当然，选举中心还要验证

190
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,366
votes otherwise remain completely private.
Of course the election center is also

191
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:56,331
投票者是否能投票以及只能投一次

192
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:56,331
gonna verify that this voter for example
is allowed to vote and that the voter has

193
00:06:56,331 --> 00:07:00,818
除了那些信息，选举中心及其他人

194
00:06:56,331 --> 00:07:00,818
only voted once. But other than that
information the election center and the

195
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:05,484
无从知晓各投票人的选择

196
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:05,484
rest of the world learned nothing else
about that voter's vote other than the

197
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:10,104
除了最终选举结果。所以这是一个涉及六方协议的例子

198
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:10,104
result of the election. So this is an
example of a protocol that involves six

199
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:14,430
在这个情况下，有五个投票者在一个选举中心

200
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:14,430
parties. In this case, there are five
voters in one election center. These

201
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,417
参与者计算他们自己的投票结果，最后选举的结果可以得出

202
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,417
parties compute amongst themselves. And at
the end of the computation, the result of

203
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:24,404
不过个人投票决定是不被泄露的。

204
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:24,404
the election is known but nothing else is
revealed about the individual inputs. Now

205
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:29,156
对于私密的拍卖也有类似问题

206
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:29,156
a similar problem comes up in the context
of private auctions. So in a private

207
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:34,160
在私密拍卖中每个买家都有自己愿意出的标价

208
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:34,160
auction every bidder has his own bid that
he wants to bid. And now suppose the

209
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,356
假设拍卖机制使用的是Vickrey拍卖

210
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,356
auction mechanism that's being used is
what's called a Vickrey auction where the

211
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:45,287
Vickrey拍卖的中标者为出价最高者

212
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:45,287
definition of a Vickrey auction is that
the winner is the highest bidder. But the

213
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:50,099
但中标者付的钱为第二高的出价

214
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:50,099
amounts that the winner pays is actually
the second highest bid. So he pays the

215
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,850
所以他付第二高的出价，这就是Vickrey拍卖机制

216
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,850
second highest bid. Okay, so this is a
standard auction mechanism called the

217
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,028
现在我们想做的是让参与者能计算

218
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,028
Vickrey auction. And now what we'd like to
do is basically enable the participants to

219
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:04,779
算出最高出价者和该付的钱

220
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:04,779
compute, to figure out who the highest
bidder is and how much he's supposed to

221
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,165
但除了这些，所有其他关于个人投票的信息保密

222
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,165
pay, but other than that, all other
information about the individual bids

223
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:14,160
例如，最高出价者的数额保密

224
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:14,160
should remain secret. So for example, the
actual amount that the highest bidder bid

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,225
为公众所知的只有第二高价的数额

226
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,225
should remain secret. The only thing that
should become public is the second highest

227
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:23,526
和出最高价者是谁。又一次的，我们现在需要

228
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:23,526
bid and the identity of the highest
bidder. So again now, the way we will do

229
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:28,172
引入拍卖中心，类似的选举中心，

230
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:28,172
that is we'll introduce an auction center, and
in a similar way, essentially, everybody

231
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:32,588
每个人都会把其加密的投标送给拍卖中心

232
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:32,588
will send their encrypted bids to the
auction center. The auction center will

233
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:37,119
拍卖中心会计算中标者是谁，以及第二高价

234
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:37,119
compute the identity of the winner and in
fact he will also compute the second

235
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,822
不过除了这些，个人标价不被泄露

236
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,822
highest bid but other than these two
values, nothing else is revealed about the

237
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:46,126
这其实是一个更广泛的问题

238
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:46,126
individual bids. Now, this is actually an
example of a much more general problem

239
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,264
叫做安全多方计算。让我解释一下安全多方计算是什么

240
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,264
called secure multi-party computation. Let
me explain what secure multi-party

241
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:54,618
抽象的，参与者自己有一个秘密输入

242
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:54,618
computation is about. So here, basically
abstractly, the participants have a secret

243
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,649
在选举中，输入将是投票

244
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,649
inputs to themselves. So, in the case of
an election, the inputs would be the

245
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,787
在拍卖中，输入将是秘密投标

246
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,787
votes. In the case of an auction, the
inputs would be the secret bids. And then

247
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:06,959
然后他们想计算一个关于这些输入的函数

248
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:06,959
what they would like to do is compute some
sort of a function of their inputs.

249
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,840
在选举中，函数为大多数

250
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,840
Again, in the case of an election, the
function's a majority. In the case of

251
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,088
在拍卖中，函数为第二高价X1到X4的最大值

252
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,088
auction, the function happens to be the
second highest, largest number among x one

253
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:19,179
问题是，怎么办才能得知函数值

254
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:19,179
to x four. And the question is, how can
they do that, such that the value of the

255
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,375
同时个人投票信息保密呢？

256
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,375
function is revealed, but nothing else is
revealed about the individual votes? So

257
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,675
我来展示一个蠢且不安全的方法。我们引入一个可信赖方

258
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,675
let me show you kind of a dumb, insecure
way of doing it. What we do is introduce a

259
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:31,774
这个可信赖方收集个人输入

260
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:31,774
trusted party. And then, this trusted
authority basically collects individual

261
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:36,223
它保证不泄露个人输入

262
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:36,223
inputs. And it kinda promises to keep the
individual inputs secret, so that only it

263
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:40,510
它自己是知道的。
然后，可信赖方公开发布函数结果

264
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:40,510
would know what they are. And then, it
publishes the value of the function, to

265
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,742
目的是，函数值公开

266
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,742
the world. So, the idea is now that the
value of the function became public, but

267
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:48,812
但个人输入依然未泄露

268
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:48,812
nothing else is revealed about the
individual inputs. But, of course, you got

269
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:52,990
当然，你是信任这个可信赖方的，若出于某些原因，

270
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:52,990
this trusted authority that you got to
trust, and if for some reason it's not

271
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,168
它不可信了，你就有麻烦了，密码学有一个非常核心的定理

272
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,168
trustworthy, then you have a problem. And
so, there's a very central theorem in

273
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:01,001
揭示了一个非常惊人的事实。定理说

274
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:01,001
crypto and it really is quite a
surprising fact. That says that any

275
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,204
任何你想做的计算，任何函数F

276
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,204
computation you'd like to do, any function
F you'd like to compute, that you can

277
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,302
只要你能用可信任方计算，一定也可以不借助可信任方完成

278
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,302
compute with a trusted authority, you can
also do without a trusted authority.

279
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:13,559
让我从上层来解释下，基本上，我们想做的

280
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:13,559
Let me at a high level explain what this
means. Basically, what we're gonna do, is

281
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,816
就是去掉可信任方。这样各方不会把他们的输入

282
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,816
we're gonna get rid of the authority. So
the parties are actually not gonna send

283
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:21,807
给可信任方。事实上系统中没有可信任方了

284
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:21,807
their inputs to the authority. And, in
fact, there's no longer going to be an

285
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:26,011
取而代之的是，各参与者使用

286
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:26,011
authority in the system. Instead, what the
parties are gonna do, is they're gonna

287
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:30,567
某些协议互相通信。在协议的最后

288
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:30,567
talk to one another using some protocol.
Such that at the end of the protocol all

289
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:34,890
函数值突然被大家知道

290
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:34,890
of a sudden the value of the function
becomes known to everybody. And yet

291
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,390
除此之外无任何信息泄露，换句话说，

292
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,390
nothing other than the value of the
function is revealed. In other words, the

293
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,639
个人投票依然保密。没有可信任方

294
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,639
individual inputs is still kept secret.
But again there's no authority, there's

295
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,867
各方相互交流就可以算出最终结果

296
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,867
just a way for them to talk to one another
such that the final output is revealed. So

297
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:51,846
这是一个很一般的结论。其普适性有点惊人

298
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:51,846
this is a fairly general result, it's kind
of a surprising fact that is at all

299
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:56,024
事实上，在本课的最后，我们将看到

300
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:56,024
doable. And in fact it is and towards the
end of the class we'll actually see how to

301
00:10:56,024 --> 00:11:00,577
这将如何实现。密码学还有些应用

302
00:10:56,024 --> 00:11:00,577
make this happen. Now, there are some
applications of cryptography that I can't

303
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,560
我无法分类，只能说他们很神奇

304
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,560
classify any other way other than to say
that they are purely magical. Let me give

305
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,240
我给两个例子。第一个叫私有外包计算

306
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,240
you two examples of that. So the first is
what's called privately outsourcing

307
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,224
为了阐明这一点，我会举一个谷歌搜索的例子

308
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,224
computation. So I'll give you an example
of a Google search just to illustrate the

309
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:20,329
假设Alice有一个搜索请求

310
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:20,329
point. So imagine Alice has a search query
that she wants to issue. It turns out that

311
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:25,434
事实上有很特殊的加密机制，可以

312
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:25,434
there are very special encryption schemes
such that Alice can send an encryption of

313
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,368
把Alice的请求加密后交给谷歌。由于加密机制的特性

314
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,368
her query to Google. And then because of
the property of the encryption scheme

315
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:35,304
谷歌可以在加密后的值上运算，无需知道原文是什么

316
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:35,304
Google can actually compute on the
encrypted values without knowing what the

317
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:40,368
所以谷歌可以在加密的请求上，运行庞大的搜索算法

318
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:40,368
plain texts are. So Google can actually
run its massive search algorithm on the

319
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:44,903
得到的是加密的结果。好，谷歌将加密后的结果

320
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:44,903
encrypted query and recover in encrypted
results. Okay. Google will send the

321
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:49,242
返回给Alice。她解密后就会得到搜索结果了

322
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:49,242
encrypted results back to Alice. Alice
will decrypt and then she will receive the

323
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:53,689
神奇的地方在于谷歌只能看到请求的加密形式，别无他物

324
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:53,689
results. But the magic here is all Google
saw was just encryptions of her queries

325
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:57,493
所以谷歌不知道Alice刚才搜索什么

326
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:57,493
and nothing else. And so, Google as a
result has no idea what Alice just

327
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:01,672
尽管Alice知道了她想要的东西

328
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:01,672
searched for and nevertheless Alice
actually learned exactly what she

329
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:05,812
好，这些是加密机制里很神奇的内容

330
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:05,812
wanted to learn. Okay so, these are
magical kind of encryption schemes. They're

331
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:09,985
他们相对较新，只有两三年的发展历史

332
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:09,985
fairly recent, this is only a new
development from about two or three years

333
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:14,436
允许加密数据上的计算，尽管我们不知道加密的内容

334
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:14,436
ago, that allows us to compute on encrypted
data, even though we don't really know

335
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:18,667
在大家急着去想怎么实现这个之前

336
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:18,667
what's inside the encryption. Now, before
you rush off and think about implementing

337
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,470
我应当警告大家目前这只是理论结果

338
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,470
this, I should warn you that this is
really at this point just theoretical, in

339
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,422
也就是说基于加密数据的谷歌搜索

340
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,422
the sense that running a Google search on
encryption data probably would take a

341
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:30,521
很可能会花上亿年，不过这个可行的事实可能已经很惊人了

342
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:30,521
billion years. But nevertheless, just the
fact that this is doable is already really

343
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,473
对于相对简单的计算也已经有应用了。

344
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,473
surprising, and is already quite useful
for relatively simple computations. So in

345
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:38,671
事实上我们稍后会看到这个的一些应用。另一个神奇的应用

346
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:38,671
fact, we'll see some applications of this
later on. The other magical application I

347
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:42,474
我将展示的叫做零知识。特别的，我要

348
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:42,474
want to show you is what's called zero
knowledge. And in particular, I'll tell

349
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:46,080
告诉大家有关知识的零知识的证明。

350
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:46,080
you about something called the zero
knowledge proof of knowledge. So here ...

351
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,177
Alice知道一个特定的数N

352
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,177
what happens is there's a certain
number N, which Alice knows. And the way

353
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:54,169
数N为两个大素数的积

354
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:54,169
the number N was constructed is as a
product of two large primes. So, imagine

355
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,835
假设我们有两个素数P和Q，每个认为有1000位

356
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,835
here we have two primes, P and Q. Each one
you can think of it as like 1000 digits.

357
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:03,892
你很可能知道乘两个1000位的数容易计算

358
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:03,892
And you probably know that multiplying
two 1000-digit numbers is fairly easy. But if

359
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:08,235
但如果给定乘积，求素数分解

360
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:08,235
I just give you their product, figuring
out their factorization into primes is

361
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:12,427
将非常困难。事实上，我们将利用这一事实

362
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:12,427
actually quite difficult. And, in fact,
we're gonna use the fact that factoring is

363
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:16,566
用因子分解的困难性建立公钥密码系统，将在本课后半段介绍。

364
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:16,566
difficult to build public key cryptosystems
in the second half of the course.

365
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:20,968
好，那么Alice有大整数N，她知道N的因子分解

366
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:20,968
Okay, so Alice happens to have this number
N, and she also knows the factorization of

367
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,898
Bob只知道数N，他不知道N的因子分解

368
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,898
N. Now Bob just has the number N. He
doesn't actually know the factorization.

369
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:28,723
知识的零知识证明的神奇之处在于

370
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:28,723
Now, the magical fact about the zero
knowledge proof of knowledge, is that

371
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:33,144
Alice能向Bob证明她知道N的因子分解

372
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:33,144
Alice can prove to Bob that she knows the
factorization of N. Yes, you can actually

373
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:37,457
是的，你可以把这个证明给Bob，Bob检查后确信Alice

374
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:37,457
give this proof to Bob, that Bob can
check, and become convinced that Alice

375
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:42,386
知道如何分解但是，Bob不知道因子P和Q

376
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:42,386
knows the factorization of N, however Bob
learns nothing at all. About the factors P

377
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:47,034
这是可证明的。Bob完全不知道P和Q两个因子

378
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:47,034
and Q, and this is provable. Bob
absolutely learns nothing at all about the

379
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,997
这个论断实际上很广泛

380
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,997
factors P and Q. And the statement
actually is very, very general. This is

381
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:55,275
它不仅仅是证明N的因子分解，事实上有很多谜题

382
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:55,275
not just about proving the factorization
of N. In fact, almost any puzzle that you

383
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:59,606
你希望证明你知道答案，你可以证明它是你的知识

384
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:59,606
want to prove that you know an answer to,
you can prove it is your knowledge. So if

385
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,831
如果你解决了一个填字游戏，可能填字游戏不是最好的例子

386
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,831
you have a crossword puzzle that you've
solved. Well, maybe crosswords is not the

387
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:07,845
如果你有一个数独谜题，例如

388
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:07,845
best example. But if you have like a
Sudoku puzzle, for example, that you want

389
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:12,282
你想证明你已经解决了，你可以向Bob证明

390
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:12,282
to prove that you've solved, you can prove
it to Bob in a way that Bob would learn

391
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:16,718
Bob无法知道怎么解的，不过Bob会相信你对本题有解。

392
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:16,718
nothing at all about the solution, and yet
Bob would be convinced that you really do

393
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:20,930
好，那些是很神奇的应用。

394
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:20,930
have a solution to this puzzle. Okay. So
those are kind of magical applications.

395
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,000
最后我想说的是现代密码学

396
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,000
And so the last thing I want to say is
that modern cryptography is a very

397
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,015
是很严格的科学。事实上我们描述的每一个概念

398
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,015
rigorous science. And in fact, every
concept we're gonna describe is gonna

399
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:33,129
都依照非常严格的三步，我们将反复利用到这三步

400
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:33,129
follow three very rigorous steps, okay,
and we're gonna see these three steps

401
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:37,338
我想解释一下他们是什么。第一件

402
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:37,338
again and again and again so I wanna
explain what they are. So the first thing

403
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:41,493
是当我们引入新的部件时，例如数字签名

404
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:41,493
we're gonna do when we introduce a new
primitive like a digital signature is

405
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:45,540
我们要准确描述威胁模型是什么

406
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:45,540
we're gonna specify precisely what the
threat model is. That is, what can an

407
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,534
就是说攻击者如何攻击数字签名，伪造签名的目的何在？

408
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,534
attacker do to attack a digital signature
and what is his goal in forging

409
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:53,851
好，我们将严格定义签名的含义

410
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:53,851
signatures? Okay, so we're gonna define
exactly what does it mean for a signature

411
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,760
例如，用于不可伪造。不可伪造。好

412
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,760
for example to be unforgeable.
Unforgeable. Okay and I'm giving digital

413
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,998
我拿数字签名作为一个例子，对每个我们描述的部件

414
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,998
signatures just as an example. For every
primitive we describe we're gonna

415
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:06,464
准确定义威胁模型，然后我们要提出构架

416
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:06,464
precisely define what the threat model is.
Then we're gonna propose a construction

417
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:10,931
证明任何攻击者在这个威胁模型下

418
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:10,931
and then we're gonna give a proof that any
attacker that's able to attack the

419
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:15,955
可以攻击这个构架，那么这个攻击者也可以用这种方法

420
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:15,955
construction under this threat model. That
attacker can also be used to solve some

421
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:20,150
解决根本性难题。如果问题真的很难

422
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:20,150
underlying hard problem. And as a result,
if the problem really is hard, that

423
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,350
实际上就证明了攻击者无法在威胁模型下，破解这个构架。

424
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,350
actually proves that no attacker can break
the construction under the threat model.

425
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,843
不过这三步非常重要

426
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,843
Okay. But these three steps are actually
quite important. In the case of

427
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,928
对于签名，我们会定义签名可伪造的含义

428
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,928
signatures, we'll define what it means for
a signature to be, forgeable, then we'll

429
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:35,914
然后我们给一个构架，例如我们会说任何人若能破解我们

430
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:35,914
give a construction, and then for example
we'll say that anyone who can break our

431
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:39,801
的构架，他也可以用他破解的方法来解决因子分解问题

432
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:39,801
construction can then be used to say
factor integers, which is believed to be a

433
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,541
后者是公认的难题。好的，我们将通篇遵循这三步

434
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,541
hard problem. Okay, so we're going to
follow these three steps throughout, and

435
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:47,331
大家将看到这个实际上是如何发生的。好，本节结束

436
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:47,331
then you'll see how this actually comes
about. Okay, so this is the end of the

437
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:51,218
下一节我们要简要谈一下密码学

438
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:51,218
segment. And then in the next segment
we'll talk a little bit about the history

439
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,006
的历史。

440
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,006
of cryptography.
