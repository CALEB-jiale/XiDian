1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,134
So now that we understand what a secure
PRG is, and we understand what semantic

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,134
现在我们知道了什么是安全PRG，什么是语义安全

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:08,425
security means, we can actually argue that
a stream cipher with a secure PRG is, in

4
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:08,425
因此我们可以证明具有安全PRG的流密码是语义安全的

5
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,559
fact, a semantically secure. So that's our
goal for this, segment. It's a fairly

6
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,559
这就是我们本节的目标

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,746
straightforward proof, and we'll see how
it goes. So the theory we wanna prove is

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,746
这是个相当简单的证明，我们来看是如何做的

9
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:20,932
that, basically, given a generator G that
happens to be a secured, psedo-random

10
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:20,932
我们要证明的理论是，给定一个安全的伪随机数发生器G

11
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:24,805
generator. In fact, the stream cipher
that's derived from this generator is

12
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:24,805
由此发生器推出的流密码将是语义安全的

13
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:28,924
going to be semantically secure. Okay and
I want to emphasize. That there was no

14
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:28,924
然而，我需要强调

15
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:33,085
hope of proving a theorem like this for
perfect secrecy. For Shannons concept of

16
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:33,085
基于香农定理本身的完善保密性，想对类似的理论进行证明是不可能的

17
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:37,193
perfect secrecy. Because we know that a
stream cipher can not be perfectly

18
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:37,193
因为我们知道流密码的密钥太短，不满足完善保密性

19
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:41,264
secure because it has short keys. And
perfect secrecy requires the keys to be as

20
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:41,264
完善保密性要求密钥至少要和明文一样长

21
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:45,321
long as the message. So this is really
kind of the first example the we see where

22
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:45,321
那么这是我们看到的

23
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:49,229
we're able to prove that a cipher with
short keys has security. The concept of

24
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:49,229
第一个真正能够证明短密钥密码也具有安全性的例子

25
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,236
security is semantic security. And this
actually validates that, really, this is a

26
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,236
即语义安全的概念

27
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,943
very useful concept. And in fact, you
know, we'll be using semantic security

28
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,943
这也说明语义安全是一个很重要的概念

29
00:00:56,943 --> 00:01:00,750
many, many times throughout the course.
Okay, so how do we prove a theory like

30
00:00:56,943 --> 00:01:00,750
这门课我们将会反复用到语义安全这个概念

31
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,257
this? What we're actually gonna be doing,
is we're gonna be proving the

32
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,257
那么我们如何证明这个定理？事实上我们将证明它的逆否命题

33
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:08,264
contrapositive. What we're gonna show is
the following. So we're gonna prove this

34
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:08,264
我们来进行如下证明

35
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:12,815
statement down here, but let me parse it
for you. Suppose. You give me a semantic

36
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:12,815
我们要证的这个命题，让我来解析一下

37
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:18,345
security adversary A. What we'll do is
we'll build PRG adversary B to satisfy

38
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:18,345
假设有一个威胁语义安全的敌手A，我们要构造一个PRG敌手B来满足这个不等式

39
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:23,686
this inequality here. Now why is this
inequality useful? Basically what do we

40
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:23,686
为什么要满足这个不等式？我们知道什么？

41
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:28,878
know? We know that if B is an efficient
adversary. Then we know that since G is a

42
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:28,878
我们知道如果B是一个有效敌手，那么由于发生器G是安全的

43
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:33,053
secure generator, we know that this
advantage is negligible, right? A secure

44
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:33,053
我们就知道这个优势是可以被忽略的，对吧？

45
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:37,510
generator has a negligible advantage
against any efficient statistical test. So

46
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:37,510
一个安全的发生器对于一切有效统计测试都具有可忽略的优势

47
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,023
the right hand side, basically, is gonna
be negligible. But because the right hand

48
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,023
所以右边基本上是可以忽略的

49
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:46,023
side is negligible, we can deduce that the
left hand side is negligible.

50
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:46,023
由于右边是可忽略的，我们可以推断左边也是可忽略的

51
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,767
And therefore, the adversary that you looked
at actually has negligible advantage in

52
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,767
因此敌手对于流密码E的优势是可忽略的

53
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:54,538
attacking the stream cipher E. Okay. So
this is how this, this will work.

54
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:54,538
这就是这个式子的含义

55
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:58,486
Basically all we have to do is given an
adversary A we're going to build an

56
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:58,486
给定任一敌手A，我们要构造出一个敌手B。

57
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:02,591
adversary B. We know that B has negligible
advantage against generator but that

58
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:02,591
我们知道B对于发生器的优势是可忽略的

59
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:06,036
implies that A has negligible advantage
against the stream cipher.

60
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:06,036
这意味着A对于流密码的优势也是可忽略的

61
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:10,994
So let's do that. So all we have to do again
is given A, we have to build B.

62
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:10,994
这就是我们要做的，给定A，我们只需要构造B

63
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:15,183
So let A be a semantic security adversary against
the stream cipher. So let me remind you

64
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:15,183
设A为一流密码下的语义安全的敌手

65
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:19,320
what that means. Basically, there's a
challenger. The challenger starts off by

66
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:19,320
回想一下这里的含义。即有一个挑战者选择密钥K

67
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,509
choosing the key K. And then the adversary
is gonna output two messages, two equal

68
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,509
然后敌手输出两个等长的明文M0和M1

69
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:27,383
length messages. And he's gonna receive
the encryption of M0 or M1

70
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:27,383
然后他将会收到M0或者M1的密文，并输出B1

71
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:31,226
and outputs B1. Okay, that's
what a semantic security adversary is

72
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:31,226
这就是语义安全的敌手所做的

73
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:34,933
going to do. So now we're going to start
playing games with this adversary. And

74
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:34,933
现在我们与这个敌手来玩这个游戏

75
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,498
that's how we're going to prove our lemma. Alright, so the first thing

76
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,498
我们就是这样来证明引理的

77
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:42,535
we're going to do is we're going to make
the challenger. Also choose a random R.

78
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:42,535
首先我们要构造挑战者，并让其选择一个随机字符串R

79
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:47,500
Okay, a random string R. So, well you know
the adversary doesn't really care what the

80
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:47,500
敌手不关心挑战者内部是如何实现的

81
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,405
challenger does internally. The challenger
never uses R, so this doesn't affect the

82
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,405
挑战者从来不使用R

83
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,365
adversary's advantage at all. The
adversary just doesn't care that the

84
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,365
所以这不影响敌手的优势，敌手也不关心挑战者挑选的R

85
00:02:56,365 --> 00:03:00,706
challenger also picks R. But now comes the
trick. What we're going to do is we're

86
00:02:56,365 --> 00:03:00,706
然而这里有一个技巧

87
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:05,042
going to, instead of encrypting using GK.
We're going to encrypt using R. You can

88
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:05,042
我们使用R来加密而不是G(K)

89
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:09,993
see basically what we're doing
here. Essentially we're changing the

90
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:09,993
你能看到这里我们是怎么做的

91
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:14,219
challenger so now the challenge
cipher text is encrypted using a

92
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:14,219
我们使挑战者输出的密文使用真随机数进行加密

93
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,006
truly random pad. As opposed to just pseudo
random pad GK. Okay. Now, the property of

94
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,006
而不是使用伪随机数G(k)

95
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:23,639
the pseudo-random generator is that its
output is indistinguishable from truly

96
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:23,639
这个伪随机数发生器的性质是，它的输出与真随机是不可区分的

97
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,273
random. So, because the PRG is secure, the
adversary can't tell that we made this

98
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,273
因为这个PRG是安全的，敌手无法发现其中的变化

99
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:33,082
change. The adversary can't tell that we
switched from a pseudo-random string to a

100
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:33,082
敌手不知道我们是否从伪随机字符串换成了真随机字符串

101
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:37,422
truly random string. Again, because the generator is secure. Well, but now look at

102
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:37,422
这又是因为这个发生器是安全的

103
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:41,762
the game that we ended up with. So the
adversary's advantage couldn't have

104
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:41,762
现在我们来看这个游戏

105
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:46,630
changed by much, because he can't tell the
difference. But now look at the game that

106
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:46,630
敌手的优势没有明显变化，因为他无法发现其中的区别

107
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,073
we ended up with. Now this game is truly a
one time pad game. This a semantic

108
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,073
现在这个游戏是一个一次一密的游戏

109
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:55,803
security game against the one time pad.
Because now the adversary is getting a one

110
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:55,803
是一次一密下的语义安全

111
00:03:55,803 --> 00:04:00,238
time pad encryption of M0 or M1 But in the
one time pad we know that the adversaries

112
00:03:55,803 --> 00:04:00,238
因为敌手得到的M0和M1的密文使用了一次一密

113
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:04,048
advantage is zero, because you can't beat
the one time pad. The one time pad is

114
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:04,048
我们知道一次一密下敌手的优势为0，因为一次一密是不可破的

115
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:08,165
secure Unconditionally secure. And as a
result, because of this. Essentially

116
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:08,165
一次一密是无条件安全的

117
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:12,674
because the adversary couldn't have told
the difference when

118
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:12,674
因此当我们从伪随机变为真随机时，敌手无法发现这里的区别

119
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:17,013
we moved from pseudo random to random. But he couldn't win the
random game. That also means that he

120
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:17,013
他不能赢下真随机的游戏

121
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:21,411
couldn't win the sudo random game. And as
a result, the stream cipher, the original

122
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:21,411
也表示他不能赢下这个伪随机的游戏，因此最初的流密码一定是安全的

123
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:25,634
stream cipher must be secure. So that's
the intuition for how the proof is gonna go.

124
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:25,634
这就是证明的直观思路

125
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:29,594
But I wanna do it rigorously once.
From now on, we're just gonna argue by

126
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:29,594
然而我想再来严格地证明一下

127
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,975
playing games with our challenger. And, we
won't be doing things as formal as I'm

128
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,975
从现在开始，我们与挑战者进行游戏

129
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:38,304
gonna do next. But I wanna do formally and
precisely once, just so that you see how

130
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:38,304
以后我们不会这样正式来做，但这一次我想正式而精确地说明证明的原理

131
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:42,629
these proofs actually work. Okay, so I'm
gonna have to introduce some notation. And

132
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:42,629
我们需要引入一些记号

133
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,751
I'll do the usual notation, basically. If
the original semantics are here at the

134
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,751
基本都用常见的记号

135
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:52,937
beginning, when we're actually using a
pseudo-random pad, I'm gonna use W0 and W1

136
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:52,937
使用伪随机时，我用W0和W1分别表示

137
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:58,059
to denote the event that the adversary
outputs one, when it gets the encryption

138
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:58,059
敌手在接收到M0或M1的密文的情况下

139
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:02,856
of M0, or gets the encryption of M1,
respectively. Okay? So W0 corresponds to

140
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:02,856
输出1的事件

141
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:07,719
outputting 1 when receiving the
encryption of M0. And W1 corresponds

142
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:07,719
所以W0表示接收到M0的密文时输出1

143
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:13,141
to outputting 1 when receiving the encryption of M1. So that's the standard

144
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:13,141
W1表示接收到M1的密文时输出1

145
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:19,606
definition of semantic security. Now once
we flip to the random pad. I'm gonna use

146
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:19,606
这是语义安全的标准定义。现在来看真随机

147
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:24,505
R0 and R1 to denote the event that the
adversary outputs 1 when receiving the

148
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:24,505
我用R0和R1分别表示敌手在接收到M0和M1的密文的情况下

149
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:29,125
one-type pad encryption of M0 or the
one-time pad encryption of M1. So we have

150
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:29,125
输出1的事件

151
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,567
four events, W0, W1 from the original
semmantics security game, and R0 and R1

152
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,567
所以我们得到4个事件。W0，W1来自最初语义安全的游戏

153
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,365
from the semmantics security game once we
switch over to the one-time pad. So now

154
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,365
R0，R1来自切换到一次一密后的游戏

155
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:42,985
let's look at relations between these
variables. So first of all, R0 and R1 are

156
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:42,985
现在我们来看这些变量的关系

157
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:47,427
basically events from a semmantics
security game against a one-time pad. So

158
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:47,427
首先，R0和R1是一次一密下语义安全的事件

159
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:51,929
the difference between these probabilities
is that, as we said, basically the

160
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:51,929
因此概率之差就等于

161
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:56,902
advantage of algorithm A, of adversary A,
against the one-time pad. Which we know is

162
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:56,902
敌手A对于一次一密的优势，即为0

163
00:05:56,902 --> 00:06:01,231
zero. Okay, so that's great. So that
basically means that probability of, of R0

164
00:05:56,902 --> 00:06:01,231
很好，这表示R0的概率等于R1的概率

165
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:05,662
is equal to the probability of R1. So now,
let's put these events on a line, on a

166
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:05,662
我们来把这些事件放在一条线上

167
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:10,261
line segment between zero and one. So here
are the events. W0 and W1 are the events

168
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:10,261
区间在0到1之间

169
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:14,499
we're interested in. We wanna show that
these two are close. Okay. And the way

170
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:14,499
我们关心的是W0和W1，我们想证明它们很接近

171
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,490
we're going to do it is basically by
showing, oh and I should say, here is

172
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,490
我们要做的是

173
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,754
probability R0 and R1, it says
they're both same, I just put them in the

174
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,754
这里是R0和R1，它们相等，所以放在了一起

175
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:27,237
same place. What we're gonna do is we're
gonna show that both W0 and W1 are

176
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:27,237
我们要说明W0和W1都接近于Rb

177
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:31,720
actually close to the probability of RB
and as a result they must be close to one

178
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:31,720
所以它们彼此之间一定也接近

179
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,656
another. Okay, so the way we do that is
using a second claim, so now we're

180
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,656
我们利用第二个论断来说明

181
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:39,865
interested in the distance between
probability of Wb and the probability of

182
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:39,865
这里我们关注的是Wb和Rb之间的距离

183
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:44,730
Rb. Okay so we'll prove the claim in a
second. Let me just state the claim. The

184
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:44,730
我们稍后来证明这个论断，首先我来说明一下

185
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,938
claim says that there exists in adversary
B. Such that the difference of these two

186
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,938
这个论断指出存在敌手B

187
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:55,081
probabilities is basically the advantage
of B against the generator G and this is

188
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:55,081
使得这两个概率之差等于敌手B对于发生器G的优势，对b的两个取值都成立

189
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,833
for both b's. Okay? So given these two
claims, like the theorem is done because

190
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,833
因此给定了这两个论断，就证明了这个定理

191
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:04,771
basically what do we know. We know this
distance is less than the advantage of B

192
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:04,771
因为我们知道这个距离小于B对于G的优势

193
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:09,523
against G. That's from claim two and
similarly, this distance actually is even

194
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:09,523
根据论断2，这个距离就等于B对于G的优势

195
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:14,401
equal to, I'm not gonna say
less but is equal to the advantage. Of B

196
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:14,401
而不是小于B对于G的优势

197
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:19,455
against G, and as a result you can see
that the distance between W0 and W1

198
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:19,455
因此正如你所看到的

199
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:24,446
is basically almost twice the
advantage of B against G. That's basically

200
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:24,446
W0和W1之间的距离最多为B对于G优势的两倍

201
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:29,375
the thing that we are trying to prove.
Okay the only thing that remains is just

202
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:29,375
这就是我们要证明的

203
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:34,304
proving this claim two and if you think
about what claim two says, it basically

204
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:34,304
因此剩下要做的就是证明论断2

205
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:39,170
captures the question of what happens in
experiment zero what happens when we

206
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:39,170
论断2表示的是当伪随机G(k)被替换成真随机R后

207
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,530
replace the pseudo random pad GK, by
truly random pad R. Here in

208
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,530
实验0产生的变化

209
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,910
experiment zero say we're using the pseudo
random pad and here in experiment zero we

210
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,910
在这个实验0中，我们使用伪随机

211
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,593
are using a Truly random pad and we are
asking can the adversary tell the

212
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,593
而在这个实验0中则使用真随机

213
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:58,972
difference between these two and we wanna
argue that he cannot because the generator

214
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:58,972
我们让敌手分辨这两者，然后我们想证明这是不可能的，因为发生器是安全的

215
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:03,845
is secure. Okay so here's what we are
gonna do. So let's prove claim two. So we

216
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:03,845
这就是我们要做的，我们来证明论断2

217
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:08,728
are gonna argue that in fact there is a
PRG adversary B that has exactly the

218
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:08,728
我们要证明有一敌手B对于PRG的优势

219
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,764
difference of the two probabilities as
it's advantage. Okay and since the point

220
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,764
严格等于这两个概率之差

221
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:18,319
is since this is negligible this is
negligible. And that's basically what we

222
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:18,319
因为这个是可忽略的，这个也是可忽略的 这就是我们想证明的

223
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,323
wanted to prove. Okay, so let's look at
the statistical test b. So, what, our

224
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,323
我们来看统计测试b

225
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:26,514
statistical test b is gonna use adversary
A in his belly, so we get to build

226
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:26,514
我们的统计测试b将在内部用到敌手A

227
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:31,091
statistical test b however we want. As we
said, it's gonna use adversary A inside of

228
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:31,091
因此我们根据需要构建统计测试b 正如我们说过的，内部使用敌手A

229
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:35,558
it, for its operation, and it's a regular
statistical test, so it takes an n-bit

230
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:35,558
是一个常规的统计测试

231
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:39,694
string as inputs, and it's supposed to
output, you know, random or non-random,

232
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:39,694
使用n位比特字符串作为输入，判断输出随机或不随机，0还是1

233
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:43,995
zero or one. Okay, so let's see. So it's,
first thing it's gonna do, is it's gonna

234
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:43,995
我们来看它首先做了什么

235
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:48,407
run adversary A, and adversary A is gonna
output two messages, M0 and M1. And then,

236
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:48,407
运行敌手A，敌手A输出两个信息M0和M1

237
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:54,053
what adversary b's gonna do, is basically
gonna respond. With M0 XOR or the string that

238
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:54,053
敌手B用M0与输入的字符串异或，返回给A

239
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:59,942
it was given as inputs. Alright? That's
the statistical lesson, then. Whenever A

240
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:59,942
这就是这个统计测试

241
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:05,418
outputs, it's gonna output, its output.
And now let's look at its advantage. So

242
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:05,418
A的输出就是统计测试的输出 现在我们来看它的优势

243
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:10,477
what can we say about the advantage of
this statistical test against the

244
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:10,477
所以统计测试对于发生器的优势是多少？

245
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:15,606
generator? Well, so by definition, it's
the probability that, if you choose a

246
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:15,606
根据定义，如果你选择一个真随机字符串

247
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:20,527
truly random string. So here are 01 to the N, so probability

248
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:20,527
这里是{0,1}^n

249
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:25,587
that R, that B outputs 1 minus the
probability, is that when we choose a

250
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:25,587
B输出1的概率减去当我们选择伪随机字符串时

251
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:32,603
pseudo random string, B outputs 1, okay?
Okay, but let's think about what this is.

252
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:32,603
B输出1的概率，对吧?

253
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:37,398
What can you tell me about the first
expressions? What can you tell me about

254
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:37,398
想一想第一个式子说明了什么？这个式子说明了什么？

255
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:42,256
this expression over here? Well, by the
definition that's exactly if you think

256
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:42,256
根据定义，想想这里发生的

257
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:47,366
about what's going on here, that's this is
exactly the probability R0 right?

258
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:47,366
这个式子就等于R0的概率，对吧？

259
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:52,729
Because this game that we are playing with
the adversary here is basically he helped

260
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:52,729
因为我们与敌手玩的这个游戏中敌手输出M0和M1

261
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:58,028
us M0 and M1 right here he helped add M0 and m1 and he got the encryption

262
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:58,028
他得到了M0和M1一次一密加密后的密文

263
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:03,919
of M0 under truly one time pad. Okay,
so this is basically a [inaudible]. Here

264
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:03,919
这就是一个概率

265
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:10,214
let me write this a little better. That's
the basic level probability of R0.

266
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:10,214
我来写的好看一点，这就是R0的概率

267
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,467
Now, what can we say about the next
expression, well what can we say about

268
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,467
那么第二个式子说明什么？

269
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:19,100
when B is given a pseudo random
string Y as input.

270
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:19,100
当B以伪随机字符串为输入时

271
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,493
Well in that case, this is exactly experiment zero and
true stream cipher game

272
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,493
这种情况下，这是实验0和真正的流密码的游戏

273
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:29,999
because now we're computing M XOR M0, XOR GK. This is
exactly W0.

274
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:29,999
现在我们计算M异或M0，异或G(k)，这就是W0

275
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:33,015
Okay, that's exactly what we have to prove. So it's kind of a trivial proof.

276
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:33,015
这正是我们要证明的，这是个很简单的证明

277
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:39,563
Okay, so that completes the proof of claim two. And again, just to
make sure this is all clear, once we have

278
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:39,563
好，论断2就证明完毕了 为确保讲清楚了

279
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:43,799
claim two, we know that W0 must be close
to W1, and that's the theorem.

280
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:43,799
一但证明了论断2，我们就知道W0一定接近于W1

281
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:50,383
That's what we have to prove. Okay, so now we've
