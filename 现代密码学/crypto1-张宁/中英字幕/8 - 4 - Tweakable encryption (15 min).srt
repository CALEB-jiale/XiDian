1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
今天我们要学习另一种形式的加密——可调加密。
In this segment we are gonna look at
another form of encryption called

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,520
我将用磁盘加密作为一种应用来给出使用可调加密的理由，
tweakable encryption. I'm gonna motivate
tweakable encryption using disk encryption

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,370
并且我们将了解磁盘加密作为确定性加密的另一种应用。
as an application and we'll see disk
encryption as yet another application for

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:15,255
所以磁盘加密的问题就是我们想在磁盘上将扇区加密。
deterministic encryption. So the disk
encryption problem is that we wanna

5
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:19,790
每个扇区长为4kb，现在的问题是没有扩展空间。
encrypt sectors on disk. Say each sector
is four kilobytes long and the problem is

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,492
换句话说，如果扇区大小是4KB，
that there is no space to expand. In other
words if the sector size is four kilobytes

7
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:28,585
那么密文的大小也必须是4KB，因为
the cipher text size also has to be
exactly four kilobyte because there is

8
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:32,402
如果密文比文件更大，我们将没有空间存放多余的信息。
nowhere to write the extra bits if the
cipher text was bigger than the plaintext.

9
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:37,564
我们的目标就是建立一个无扩展的加密，
And so our goal is basically to build a
non expanding encryption where the cipher

10
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:41,905
并使其密文的大小和主文件大小一样。
text size is identical exactly equal to
the plaintext size. So what does it mean

11
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:45,820
那么加密不能扩展到底是什么意思呢？严格来说，
that encryption can't expand? Well,
technically we were saying, basically the

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,099
就是信息大小和密文大小相等。
message space is equal to the cipher text
space. So the message space will be four

13
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:54,288
所以信息的大小回事4KB，密文的大小 也是4KB。
kilobyte messages and the cipher text
space would be also four kilobyte

14
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:58,084
在这种情况下我们必须使用磁盘加密，
messages. In this case clearly we have to
use deterministic encryption because if

15
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:02,468
因为如果加密是随机的，我们没有空间来存放其随机性。
encryption was randomized there will be no
place to store the randomness. And similarly

16
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:05,841
同理我们也没有空间存放其完整的数据，因为我们不能扩展密文或增加任何比特。
we have no room for integrity, because we can't
expand the cipher text and add any

17
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:10,714
因此我们能尽可能做到的是确定的CPA安全，这就是我们的目标。
integrity bits. So the most we can achieve
is deterministic CPA security and that's

18
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:14,264
那么现在我们有一个很简单的引理需要证明，
going to be our goal. Now it turns out
there's a really simple lemma to

19
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:19,600
简单来说是如果我们有一个主文件和密文大小相同的
prove, that basically says if you give me
a deterministically CPA secure cipher

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,636
确定性CPA安全的密码，也就是不能扩展，
where the message space is equal to the
cipher text space, so no expansion, then in

21
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:28,043
那么事实上密码就是PRP。那么我们现在讨论的实质是如果我们
fact the cipher is a PRP. So, really all
we're saying here is if we want no

22
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:32,038
不想扩展，我们加密时唯一的选择就是使用我们在前面的课程中
expansion at all our only option for
encrypting is what we called construction

23
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:37,664
称作NO.2结构。即我们必须运用PRPR来加密，
number two in the previous segment. Namely
we have to encrypt using a PRP. So, let's

24
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,939
那么让我看看怎么用PRP来加密。我们来看磁盘，将其分解成扇区。
look at how we might encrypt using a
PRP. Well, we take our disk, and we break

25
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,182
现在，如果我们队每一个扇区用相同的密码下的PRP加密，
it into sectors. And now, if we encrypted
every sector using a PRP under the same

26
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:52,098
我们就遇到了确定性加密的一个通常的问题。
key, we kind of run into our standard
problem with deterministic encryption.

27
00:01:52,098 --> 00:01:57,210
即，如果扇区一和扇区三的某些文件相同，
Namely, if sector one and sector three
happen to have the same plain text, then

28
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,303
那么加密果断扇区一将和加密过的扇区三相等，
the encrypted sector one would be equal to
the encrypted sector three and the

29
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:04,924
敌手也将知道相关的主文件是相同的。
attacker would learn that the
corresponding plain texts are the same.

30
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:09,122
这种情况是一个很真实的问题，举个例子，
Now this actually is a real problem for
example, if your, if some of your sectors

31
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:13,267
如果某些扇区是空白的，你知道它们全部被置零，那么事实上加密的扇区
are empty you know they are all set to
zero then in fact the encrypted sectors

32
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:17,518
会是完全相同的，因此敌手也将准确的知道在你的硬盘上
would be identical and as a result the
attacked would know exactly which sectors

33
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:21,784
哪些扇区是空的，哪些不是。所以这事实上是非常棘手的，
on your disk are empty and which sectors
are not. So this is actually quite

34
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:26,577
那么我们能不能解决得更好些呢。答案是可以。
problematic and the question is, can we do
any better? And so the answer is yes, and

35
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:31,720
第一个解决的办法是，我们可以对每一个扇区使用不同的密码。
the first idea that comes to mind is well,
why don't we use a different key for every

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,318
那么扇区一用密码一来加密，
sector? So you can see sector number one
gets encrypted with key one, sector number

37
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,153
扇区二运用密码而，以此类推。那么现在即使扇区一的内容
two gets encrypted with key two and so on
and so forth. So now even if the content

38
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:44,395
和扇区三的内容相同，扇区一和扇区三的密文也是不同的
of sector number one is equal to sector
number three the cipher text of sector one

39
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:48,018
因为他们是通过不同的密码来加密的。
and sector three will be different because
they are encrypted under different keys.

40
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:52,118
因此这种方法事实上避免了我们前面谈到的纰漏，
So this actually avoids the leakage that
we talked about before although I do want

41
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:55,971
不过我想指出，使用这种方法也会产生一些纰漏。
to point out that there is still a little
bit of leakage with this mode. For example

42
00:02:55,971 --> 00:03:01,295
例如，如果使用者改变了扇区一种的一比特内容，那么该扇区
if the user happened to change one bit in
sector one and then that sector gets

43
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:05,691
也相应地加密成不同的密文。这样就会形成误解，
encrypted into a different cipher text. So
this will be garbled all completely,

44
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:09,323
因为我们使用的是一种伪随机排列，扇区会映射为全新的随机输出，
because this is a pseudo random
permutation, the sector will be-- even if

45
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,642
即使只是改变了原文件中的一比特。
one bit of the plain text changes, the
sector will be just mapped to a completely

46
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:18,654
然而，如果使用者将这个变化恢复原状，扇区也恢复原来的样子，
new random output. However, if the user
then undoes the change, and reverts back

47
00:03:18,654 --> 00:03:23,275
那么加密扇区也会恢复原样，
to the original sector, then the encrypted
sector will revert back to its original

48
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:27,544
敌手也会清楚使用者改变了一些信息然后恢复了。
state, and the attacker can tell that a
change was made and then reverted. So,

49
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:31,153
那么还是有一些信息泄露了。但是对于这种形式的
there's still a little bit of
information leakage. But that type of

50
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:34,659
信息泄露，我们除了将其牺牲掉以外没有什么办法可以解决。
information leakage, there's really
nothing we can do without really

51
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,422
因此我们将忽视它，将其视为可接受的。
sacrificing performance. So, we're just
going to ignore that and deem that

52
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:42,616
下一个问题及时现在我们的磁盘事实上容量很大，
acceptable. So the next question is now
you realize our disks are actually getting

53
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:46,856
扇区很多。这就意味着我们要生成
pretty big and there are lots of sectors.
So this would mean that we are generating

54
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:50,295
很多很多的密码。但是显然我们不需要存储所有的这些密钥。
lots and lots of keys here, but of course
we don't have to store all these keys, we

55
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:54,437
我们可以简单地运用一个伪随机函数来生成这些密钥。
can simply generate these keys using a
pseudo random function. So, the way this

56
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:58,538
这种方式就是我们有一个主密钥，我们称之为K。
would work is we would have a master key
which we would call K. And then the sector

57
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:03,253
接下来——我们称之为扇区T将用主密钥加密。
number which I'm gonna denote by T is
gonna be encrypted using the master key.

58
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:06,838
加密的结果将是特别的扇区密钥，
And the result of that encryption would be
the particular sector key, which I'll

59
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:11,635
我们称之为KsubT。现在
denote by K sub T. Now the reason this is
secured is again because the PRF is

60
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:15,475
因为PRF在我们的随机函数中是不可区分的，也就是说如果我们
indistinguishable from our random
function, which means that basically if we

61
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:20,389
为这些扇区一，二，三，四直到L，申请一个随机函数，
apply a random function to these sector
numbers, one, two, three, four, up to L,

62
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:25,253
他们会在密钥区映射为完全随机的元素，
they basically get mapped to completely
random elements in the key space and as a

63
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:29,618
因此我们给每个扇区运用一个新的随机的独立的密钥完成了加密。
result we are encrypting every sector
using a new random independent key. So

64
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:33,718
这是一个完善的结构，那么再来，我们为每一个扇区都要申请PRF，
this is a fine construction, however
again, for every sector we would have to

65
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:37,906
那么很自然的，我们能不能做得更好些呢？当然是可以的。
apply this PRF. And so the natural
question is, can we do even better? And it

66
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:43,391
这种方式概念下的可调块密码是
turns out we can. And this introduces this
concept of a tweakable block cipher where

67
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:48,442
我们有一个主密钥。并且我们希望这个主密钥
really what we want is basically to have
one master key. And we want this one

68
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:53,396
能派生出许多许多的PRP。所以我们说的一种方法是
master key to derive many, many,
many PRPs. So we said one way to do that

69
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:59,008
简单的运用密钥K和PRP加密。但是就像我们看到的，还有
is simply encrypt the key K using the PRP
number. But as we'll see, there's a more

70
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:03,598
跟有效的方法。现在PRP事实上是我们称作一种调整，
efficient way to do that. Now this PRP
number is actually what's called a tweak,

71
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:08,071
这里引出了可调的概念，一个可调整的块密钥。
and that introduces this concept of
tweakable, a tweakable block cipher. So in

72
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:12,602
因此在一个可调的块密码中，加密和解密算法通常
a tweakable block cipher, the encryption
and decryption algorithm basically, as

73
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:17,250
将密钥作为输入，它们将可调作为输入。首字母T就是可调区域的简称。
usual, take a key as input, they take a
tweak as input. This capital T is what's

74
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,383
并且显然它将数据作为输入，
called the tweak space. And of course they
take the data as input and they output

75
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:26,777
并在X中输出数据。其性质是在随机密钥的可调区中做每一次调整。
data in the set X. The property is such that for
every tweak in a tweak space in a random

76
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:31,572
一般来说如果我们设置了密钥和调整，我们将得到一个可逆函数
key. Basically if we fix the key and the
tweak, then we end up with an invertible

77
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:36,193
一个在X重点一对一的函数。并且因为密钥是随机的，
function, a one to one function on the
set X. And because the key is random with

78
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:40,063
函数事实上也是不可分辨的。
the, the function is in fact
indistinguishable from random. In other

79
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:44,626
换句话说，对于每一套调整，我们得到一个PRP，
words, for every setting of the tweak, we
basically get a PRP, an independent PRP

80
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:48,843
一个从X到X的独立的PRP。正如我所说，我们现在申请的就是
from X to X. And as I said, the
application for this is now we're going to

81
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:53,343
要将扇区编号用作调整，因此每一个扇区
use the sector number as the tweak, and as
a result, every sector is going to get its

82
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:58,336
都能得到他自己的独立的PRP。那么我快速地定义一下
own independent PRP. So let me very, very
quickly just define more precisely what is

83
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:03,041
安全可调分组密码的实质。正如我们所说有一个可调区。有密钥，
a secure tweakable block cipher. So as we
said there's a tweak space. There's a key,

84
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:07,025
可调区，和不可见的区域X。通常，我们定义两个实验。
a tweak space and an [inaudible] space X.
And as usual, we define our two

85
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:12,196
在实验一中我们要做的是
experiments. Here in experiment one what's
gonna happen is we are gonna choose a

86
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:17,251
选择一个随机序列。不只是一个序列，我们要选择
truly random set of permutations. So not
just one permutation we're gonna choose as

87
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:22,305
和调整数目一样数目的序列。那么可以明白这就是为什么我们
many permutations as there are tweaks. So
you notice this is why we raise this to the

88
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:26,521
将这个增加至可调区的大小。如果可调区的大小是5，这就是说我们要
size of the tweak space. If the size of
the tweak space is five, this says we are

89
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:31,877
在X中选择5个随机序列。在另一种情况中，
choosing five random permutations on the
set X. And in the other case, basically,

90
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:35,429
我们要选择随机密钥，并且我们将用之前在可调区中的调整
we're just gonna, you know, choose a
random key, and we're gonna define our set

91
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:40,665
来定义这一套序列。
of permutations as the ones defined by
the, by tweaks in the tweak space. And

92
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:43,835
并且敌手将模仿调整和X区。
then the adversary basically gets to
submit a tweak and an X. And he gets to

93
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:48,770
并且他将可以得到被用调整T1来定义的序列的值，在X1点所求的值。
see the value of the permutation defined
by the tweak T1, evaluated at the point

94
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,340
并且他将可以得到这些很多次。再继续，
X1. And he gets to see this again and
again. And again, he gets to see the value

95
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,610
就得到了排列T2的值，再评估X2的值，这么一步一步下去。
of the permutation defined by the tweak
T2, evaluated at the point X2, and so on

96
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,220
之后他的目标是要判断与其相互作用的排列是否为真正的随机排列。
and so forth. And then his goal is to say
whether he interacted with truly random

97
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,090
如果他做不到
permutations, or pseudo random
permutations. And if he can't do it, we

98
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,810
我们就能说此可调分组密码是安全的。而与常规分组密码不同的是
say that this tweakable block cipher is
secure. So the difference from a regular

99
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,130
在常规分组密码中，你只能与一个排列作用。
block cipher, is, in a regular block
cipher, you only get to interact with one

100
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,640
而你的目标则是判断这个排列为真或假
permutation. And then your goal is to tell
whether you're interacting with a

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,470
这里你则要与随机排列T相互作用
pseudorandom permutation or a truly random
permutation. Here you get to interact with

102
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,840
然后你的目标又是判断随机排列T是否为真正的随机排列
T random permutations. And again your goal
is to tell whether the T random

103
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,430
照例如果你不能
permutations are truly random or
pseudorandom. So as usual if you can't

104
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,240
分清，如果敌手在两个实验中的表现相同，我们就说
distinguish, if the adversary behaves the
same in both experiments, we say that this

105
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,410
这个PRP是一个安全调控的REP。来看一些例子
PRP is a secure tweakable PRP. Okay. Very
good. So let's look at some examples. So

106
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,640
我们已经见过的一个小例子
we already looked at, at the trivial
example. In the trivial example, what we do,

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,240
假设密钥空间和输入空间大小一致
we just, we're gonna assume that the key
space is equal to the input space. So this

108
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,660
这个RPR的作用为，将X*X的值赋给X
PRP really acts on, you know, X times X to
X. So think of AES for example, where

109
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,070
我们考虑AES,假设考虑键空间的大小为128比特，数据空间为128比特，输出也为128比特
the key space is 128 bits, the data space
is 128 bits and of course the output is

110
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,540
再次找到一个分组可调密码
128 bits and then the way that we defined a
tweakable block cipher again there is a

111
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,360
有一个密钥，一个变形和数据的输入是基于使用我们的主键来加密的
key, a tweak and data as input is
basically we encrypt the tweak using our

112
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,680
随后我们用得到的随机密钥来加密数据
master key and then we encrypt the data
using the resulting random key. Now

113
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,690
如果我们要通过可调分组密码来加密n个分组
you realize that if we wanted to encrypt n
blocks with this tweakable block cipher,

114
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,640
这就需要2n个估值分组密码，n个估值用于加密给定的变形
this would require 2n evaluations of
the block cipher: n evaluations to encrypt

115
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,050
其他的n个估值则用于加密实际所给的数据
the given tweaks, and then n more evaluations
to encrypt the actual given data.

116
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,950
这里有一个很好的例子，可以告诉我们实际上可以做的更好
So, I want to show you a nice example,
that shows that we can actually do better.

117
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,960
这就叫做XTS结构。它实际上基于
This is called the XTS construction.
It's actually originally based on

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,420
一个被Phil Rogaway命名为XEX的模型。它按后续所说运行
a mode called XEX due to Phil Rogaway.
And it works as follows. So suppose you

119
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,010
假设有一个常规分组加密用于加密n比特的分组
give me a, a regular block cipher that
operates on n-bit blocks. So not a

120
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,740
并不是可调分组加密，仅仅只是一个常规分组加密
tweakable block cipher, just a regular
block cipher. We're gonna define a

121
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,660
我们想要定义一个可调分组加密，而它将会用两个密钥作为输入
tweakable block cipher. So again, this
tweakable block cipher is gonna take two

122
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,340
为了方便，你要马上看到的调整空间
keys as input. The tweak space, for
convenience, which you're gonna see in

123
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,810
我们将假设这个调整空间由两个值T和I组成
just a minute, we're gonna assume this
tweak space is made up of, of two values,

124
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,100
T将作为我们马上能看到的调整值
T and I. T is going to be some, you know, some
tweak value which we'll see in a minute, and I is

125
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,470
而I则将作为索引。X将为n比特字符串
going to be some index. And then X is
going to be an n-bit string which we're

126
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,060
我们将运用可调分组加密在X上。接下来就是XTS的运行方式
going to apply the tweakable block cipher
to. So, the way XTS works is as follows.

127
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,770
首先我们要加密左边一般的变形
The first thing we're going to do is we're
going to encrypt the left half of the

128
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,260
也就是T，运用密钥K2,，得到的结果为N
tweak, namely T, using the key K2 and we're
going to call the result N. So now what

129
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,860
将信息m异或填充函数P（N,I）
we're gonna do is we're gonna XOR the
message m with some padding function

130
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,580
而N的值是我们派生的，这个填充函数
applied to this value N that we just
derived, at the index I. And this padding

131
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,980
运行非常快。我们完全可以忽略它的运行时间
function is extremely fast. We can pretty
much ignore it in the running time. The

132
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,930
接下来我们就要用密钥K2来加密
next thing we do is we're gonna encrypt
using the key k2. And then we're going

133
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,860
用相同的填充函数P（N,I）再做一次异或
to XOR again, using the same pad. So
we're going to XOR again using the pad

134
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,330
结果就能得到密文，我们统称为C
of N applied to I. And the result is going
to be the cipher text, which we'll denote

135
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,570
而函数P是一个非常简单的函数
by C. Okay, so again as I said, the
function P is some very, very simple

136
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,160
仅仅是在有限域上的一些乘法运算
function. It's just some multiplication in
a finite field which I'm not going to

137
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,190
由于非常非常快，所以由分组密码E的运行决定运行时间
explain here. Very, very fast so the
running time is dominated by the running

138
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:21,610
这就是XTS，这个结构的好处是
time of the block cipher E and that's it. That's
XTS. And the nice thing about this construction

139
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,630
如果我们想要加密n+1个分组，就需要计算N的值
is now if we wanted to encrypt n plus one
blocks, all we do is we compute the value

140
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:32,390
对于指数1,2,3,4，我们需要对每一个分组估计PRP E的值
N once. And then for the indices one, two,
three, four basically we just need to

141
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,570
我们需要用变形T1,T2,T3,T4来加密n个分组
evaluate the PRP E once per block. So we
would need to encrypt n blocks using the

142
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,850
我们需要评估n+1个分组密码E
tweaks T,1, T,2, T,3, T,4 and so on. We
would just need n plus one evaluations of

143
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,940
它比小结构还要快两倍
the block cipher E. So it's twice
as fast as the trivial construction.

144
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,430
所以我希望你能认真看XTS结构一分钟
So I want you to stare for just a minute
at this XTS construction. So my question

145
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,350
然后解决一个问题，是不是在使用变形前真有必要对它进行加密？
to you is, is it really necessary to
encrypt the tweak before using it?

146
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,500
下面是一个安全的可调PRP结构
That is, that is the following construction
a secure tweakable PRP. So you can see

147
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,760
在这个结构中可以看到，变形是用于填充函数的输入中的异或过程
in this construction, this tweak is used
directly as input to the padding function

148
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,020
那么如果我们这么做了，这个可调PRP还安全吗？
for the XOR and my question to you is
if we did that, would that be a

149
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,960
给你一点小提示，这是密钥
secure tweakable PRP? And let me
remind you again that, this is the key,

150
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,940
这是变形和数据
this is the tweak and this is the data.

151
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,360
我希望每个人都能得到准确的答案
I hope everybody said that this is the correct answer.

152
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,900
根本上，如果我们将P（t,1）作为数据，我们将其异或上相应的变形
Basically, if we set the data to
be P(t, 1), then when we XOR it with the

153
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,990
就是我们从这里得到的P（t,1），结果为0
corresponding tweak, which is also P(t,1)
we're gonna get here, zero. And so

154
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,480
那么需要加密的就是0，无论这里出来的是什么
what's gonna get encrypted is actually
zero, so whatever that comes out to be.

155
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,600
这里得到的值为C0.那么实际上输出的就是C0异或P（t,1）
Let's say that some value, C0. And
then the actual output is just gonna be C0

156
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,650
现在对P（t,2）重复上述步骤，将得到C0异或P（t,2）
XOR P(t,1). Now when we do the same
thing with P(t, 2), we're gonna get c0

157
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,280
然后将这两者异或，即得到P(t, 1) XOR P(t, 2)
XOR P(t, 2). And when we XOR these two
things together, we just get P(t, 1) XOR P(t, 2).

158
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,370
实际上这意味着攻击者可以直接通过变形和数据查询挑战者
So the fact that this is true means
that an attacker can simply query the

159
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,660
之后就是计算两个响应异或的值
challenger at this tweak and this data,
this tweak and that data. And then just

160
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,110
并将其与合适的填充函数异或值进行比较
compute the XOR of the two responses, and
compare to the XOR of the appropriate

161
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,010
如果相等，我们就与伪随机函数进行交互
padding values. And if the equality holds,
we're interacting with a pseudorandom

162
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,420
否则我们就使其与一个真随机函数交互
function; otherwise we're interacting with
a, with a truly random function. So this

163
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,160
这就允许攻击者利用优势击溃这种结构
would allow the attacker to defeat this
construction with advantage one. So just

164
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,590
总结出XTS适用于磁盘加密
to summarize the way XTS is used for disk
encryption. What we do is we look at

165
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,910
而我们将区数T拆成16字节的分组
sector number T, and we break it into
blocks, sixteen byte blocks. And then

166
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,820
将分组1用变形T1进行加密，变形T2加密分组2
block number one gets encrypted with a
tweak, T1. Block number two gets encrypted

167
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,830
按照这个过程加密下去，每一分组就得到独立的PRP
with a tweak, T2, and so on and so forth.
And so every block gets its own PRP. And

168
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,970
整个区通过PRP集进行加密
the whole sector, as a result, is
encrypted, using, you know, a collection

169
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,350
存在一个PRP水平，但这并不是指一个区水平PRP
of PRPs. Now you notice, this is a block
level PRP. It's not a sector level PRP.

170
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,550
并不是每一个区都通过独立的PRP进行加密
So, in fact, it's not true that each
sector gets encrypted with its own PRP.

171
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,230
而是每一个分组都通过自己独立的PRP进行加密
It's just each block gets encrypted with
its own PRP. The distinction between a

172
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,030
区和分组不同点在于，有些是人为的，XTS模式实际上
sector and a block is some, somewhat
artificial, and this XTS mode actually

173
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,230
提供给你分组的16字节级别上的确定性CPA加密
provides you know, deterministic CPA
encryption at the block level, at the

174
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,900
这是一个目标，这个模式实际上在磁盘加密产品中非常受欢迎
16-byte level. That's the goal. And this
mode actually is fairly popular in disk

175
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,320
我只写几个例子来帮助了解XTS
encryption products. I just wrote a couple
of examples here that actually support

176
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,960
你应该知道磁盘加密常在实践中完成
XTS. So I wanted you to know that this is
in fact how disk encryption is commonly

177
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,160
总结一下，可调加密是一种有用的概念
done in practice. So, to summarize,
tweakable encryption is a useful concept

178
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,790
当你需要许多从单个密钥派生出的独立PRP的时候可用
to know when you need many independent
PRPs all derived from a single key. One

179
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,430
有一点很重要需要记住的是，微结构不是最有效的
important thing to remember is, in fact,
the trivial construction is not the most

180
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,070
由许多类似XTS的结构会更有效率
efficient. There are constructions like
XTS are actually more efficient, where you

181
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,530
你可以批量加密再利用，从一个变形得到许多不同变形加密
can kind of reuse encryptions from one
tweak to get many encryptions for many

182
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,040
这就是使用它们更好的方式
different tweaks. And so those are the
better ways to use them. Both the trivial

183
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,870
微结构和XTS结构都被称作狭窄分组结构
construction and the XTS construction are
what are called narrow block constructions.

184
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,490
即他们提供一个可调分组加密给16字节的分组
Namely they provide a tweakable block
ciphers for a sixteen byte block. But as we

185
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,760
我们看到在最后一段的EME结构中
said, we looked the, at the EME
construction in the last segment, which

186
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,880
为更大的分组提供了一个PRP，事实上EME是一个可调模式操作
provided a PRP for larger, much larger
blocks and in fact EME is a tweakable

187
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,750
如果你需要为更大的分组取得PRP或者是可调PRP，你只需要使用EME
mode of operation. So, if you need PRPs for larger
blocks or tweakable PRPs for larger

188
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,600
但是你应注意，在EME中，你得在每一个输入分组中运用两次分组加密
blocks then you would just use EME. But you
notice there, in EME, you had to apply the

189
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,770
所以它得到结果的速度会比XTS慢一倍
block cipher twice per input block, and
as a result it's twice as slow as

190
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,610
所以它并不是那么常用。这就是有关可调加密的内容
XTS, and is not very often used. So that's
what I wanted to say about tweakable

191
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:25,593
在下一节中我们会说到保留格式加密
encryption. And in the next segment we'll
talk about format preserving encryption.
