00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,785
大家好，我是Dan Boneh ，很高兴大家来听我的密码学课程

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,785
Hello, my name is Dan Boneh, and I'd like to welcome you to my course on cryptography

3
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:07,522
这个学季我将在斯坦福大学教授这门课程。我尝试

4
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:07,522
that I'll be teaching at Stanford University this quarter. This quarter, I'm experimenting

5
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:11,652
将课程录成下来，以便同学们在网上观看

6
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:11,652
with recording the lectures and having the students watch the lectures online.

7
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:15,438
事实上，欢迎任何人来观看我的视频并加入我们的课程

8
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:15,438
In fact, anyone is welcome to watch the lectures, and join the course.

9
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:19,211
这是一个实验，所以让我们看它进行得如何。

10
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:19,211
This is an experiment, so we'll see how it goes. My goals for this

11
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:23,151
这门课程主要是讲授密码学基本原型是怎样工作的

12
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:23,151
course are basically to teach you how cryptographic primitives work.

13
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:27,449
但更重要的是，我要教你们如何正确的使用密码学原型

14
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:27,449
But more importantly I'd like to teach you how to use cryptographic primitives correctly

15
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,928
以及推导构建加密机制的安全性，我们将会看到各种各样

16
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,928
and reason about the security of your constructions. We will see various

17
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:35,175
抽象的密码学原型，还会做一些安全性证明

18
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:35,175
abstractions of cryptographic primitives, and we'll do some security proofs.

19
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:39,013
我的目标是在课程结束后，你们能够推导加密机制的安全性

20
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:39,013
My goal is that by the end of the course you'll be able to reason about the security of cryptographic

21
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:43,211
能够破解不安全的加密机制

22
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:43,211
constructions and be able to break ones that are not secure.

23
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:47,424
关于我希望你们怎么上这门课，简单说两句，首先

24
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:47,424
Now I'd like to say a few words on how I would like you to take the class. First of all,

25
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:51,688
我非常推荐你们上课做笔记，所以我真的

26
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:51,688
I'm a big believer in taking notes as you listen to the lectures. So I would really

27
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:55,953
鼓励大家用自己的话总结归纳并记下笔记

28
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:55,953
encourage you to summarize and take notes in your own words of the material that's being presented.

29
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:59,909
提醒一下，录像的讲课速度相对于正常的课程会快很多

30
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:59,909
Also I should mention that on the videos, I'm able to go much faster

31
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,865
所以我建议大家

32
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,865
than I would go in a normal classroom. And so I would encourage you to

33
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:07,924
periodically pause the video and think about the material that's being covered

34
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:07,924
经常性地暂停视频，思考讲课内容

35
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:12,038
and not move forward until the material is clear in your mind. Also from time to time,

36
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:12,038
直到弄清楚了之后再继续

37
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,961
the video will pause and pop-up questions will come up.

38
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,961
偶尔视频自动暂停，会有弹出问题

39
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:20,347
These are intended to kinda help you along with the material, and I would really encourage you to answer

40
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:20,347
它们是帮助大家理解讲座内容的

41
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:24,682
those questions by yourselves rather than skip them. Usually the questions

42
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:24,682
我鼓励大家自主回答这些问题而不是跳过他们

43
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:28,811
are about the material that has just been covered, and so it shouldn't be too difficult to answer

44
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:28,811
通常这些问题都是关于刚刚讲过的内容，所以解答这些问题并不难

45
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:32,991
the questions. So I would really encourage you to do them rather than skip them.

46
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:32,991
我真的建议你们去解答它们而不是略过它们

47
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:37,016
Now, by now I'm sure everybody taking the class knows that cryptography is used

48
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:37,016
现在，我确信上这门课的大家都知道密码学在计算机领域无处不在

49
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:41,843
everywhere computers are. It's a very common tool that's used to protect data.

50
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:41,843
它是用来保护数据的常用工具

51
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:46,760
For example, web traffic is protected using a protocol called HTTPS.

52
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:46,760
例如，网站流量是使用HTTPS协议保护的

53
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,193
Wireless traffic, for example, Wi-Fi traffic is protected using the, WPA2

54
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,193
无线流量，例如WiFi，是使用WPA2保护

55
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:55,656
protocol, that's part of 801.11i. Cell phone traffic is protected

56
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:55,656
WAP是801.11i的一部分，手机流量是使用GSM加密机制保护的

57
00:01:55,656 --> 00:02:00,177
using an encryption mechanism in GSM. Bluetooth
traffic is protected using cryptography,

58
00:01:55,656 --> 00:02:00,177
蓝牙流量是使用密码学保护的，等等

59
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:04,640
and so on. We're gonna see how these various systems work. In fact, we're gonna

60
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:04,640
我们将看到各种各样的系统是怎样工作的

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,276
cover SSL, and in fact, even 802.11i in quite a bit of detail. And you'll see how

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,276
实际上，我们还将介绍SSL，802.11i的一些细节

63
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:13,275
these system work in practice. Cryptography is also used for protecting files

64
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:13,275
你们将会看到这些系统实际应用上是怎么工作的

65
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:17,564
that are stored on disc by encrypting them. So if the disc is stolen,

66
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:17,564
密码学也可以用来加密保护在硬盘上的文件，如果硬盘被盗

67
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:22,444
the files are not compromised. It's also used for content protection. For example

68
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:22,444
文件也不会被窃取，这也适用于保护内容。例如

69
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:27,480
when you buy DVDs and Blu-Ray disks, the movies on these disks are encrypted, in

70
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:27,480
当你买DVD和或者蓝光碟时，光盘上的电影将被加密

71
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,516
particular DVD uses a system called CSS, the Content Scrambling System, CSS, and

72
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,516
DVD使用的是CSS加密系统，也叫内容扰乱系统

73
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:37,934
Blu-Ray uses a system called AACS. We'll talk about how CSS and AACS work.

74
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:37,934
蓝光碟使用的是AACS加密系统，我们将介绍CSS和AACS是如何工作的

75
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:43,033
It turns out that CSS is a fairly easy system to break.

76
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:43,033
事实证明CSS是很容易被破解的系统

77
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:48,132
And we'll talk about how, we'll do some cryptanalysis and actually show how to break encryption that's used in CSS.

78
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:48,132
我们将学习如何破解CSS系统，对CSS中使用的密码系统进行分析和破解

79
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:52,532
Cryptography is also used for user authentication and in many, many, many

80
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:52,532
密码学也可以被用来做用户认证

81
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:56,832
other applications that we'll talk about in the next segments.  Now I wanna go back

82
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:56,832
在接下来的我们讨论的非常多的应用中。

83
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:00,642
to secure communication, and talk about the case where, here, we have a laptop

84
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:00,642
现在让我们谈回保密通信，讨论这种情况：我们有一台笔记本电脑

85
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:04,753
trying to communicate with a web server. This is a good time to also introduce our friends,

86
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:04,753
正尝试与网络服务器通信，这是一个介绍我们朋友们的好机会

87
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:08,964
Alice and Bob, who are gonna be with us throughout the quarter. Essentially Alice

88
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:08,964
Alice和Bob，他们将陪我们度过整个学季

89
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:13,305
is trying to communicate securely with Bob. Here Alice is on the laptop and Bob

90
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:13,305
Alice总是想要和Bob进行安全通信，Alice在笔记本的一端

91
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:18,223
is on the server. The protocol that's used to do that is called HTTPS, but in fact,

92
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:18,223
Bob在服务器的一端，使用的协议是HTTPS协议，但其实

93
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:22,717
the actual protocol is called SSL. Sometimes it's called TLS.

94
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:22,717
实际使用的协议是SSL，有时也被叫做TLS

95
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:27,695
And the goals of these protocols is to basically make sure that as this data travels across the

96
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:27,695
这些协议的目的是确保数据在网络传输时

97
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:32,492
network, an attacker first of all can't eavesdrop on this data. Second of all, an

98
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:32,492
首先，攻击者无法窃取数据

99
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:37,592
attacker can't modify the data while it's in the network. So no eavesdropping and no tampering.

100
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:37,592
其次，攻击者不能再修改数据，即无窃听，无篡改

101
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:42,413
Now as I said the protocol that's used to secure web traffic called TLS

102
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:42,413
现在我们来谈谈我们用来保护网页安全的TLS

103
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:46,998
actually consists of two parts. The first part is called the handshake protocol

104
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:46,998
它由两部分组成，第一部分称为握手协议

105
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:51,955
where Alice and Bob talk with one another and at the end of the handshake

106
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:51,955
Alice和Bob相互交谈，在握手的最后

107
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:56,601
handshake basically a shared secret key appears between the two of them. So both

108
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:56,601
双方共享一个密钥

109
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:01,093
Alice and Bob know this secret key, but an attacker looking at the conversation has

110
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:01,093
所以Alice和Bob双方都知道这个密钥，观察这个通信的攻击者

111
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:05,167
no idea what the key K is. Now, the way you established your secret key, the way

112
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:05,167
不知道这个会话的密钥k。现在，建立密钥的过程

113
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:09,503
you do the handshake, is using public key cryptography techniques, which we're gonna talk

114
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:09,503
握手过程，都用到了公钥密码技术，这个我们将在

115
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:13,473
about in the second part of the course. Now once Alice and Bob have the shared key,

116
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:13,473
课程的第二部讨论。现在一旦Alice和Bob共享了密钥

117
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:17,025
you can use this key to communicate securely by properly

118
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:17,025
你可以使用这个密钥安全通信，恰当地

119
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:21,364
encrypting data between them. And in fact this is gonna be the first part of the course,

120
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:21,364
加密他们相互传递的数据。事实上，这就是本课程的第一部分

121
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:25,740
which is essentially once the two sides have a shared secret key, how do they use

122
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:25,740
也就是双方共享共享密钥后，

123
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,060
that secret key to encrypt and protect data that goes back and forth between them?

124
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,060
怎么使用密钥加密并保护通信数据

125
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,404
Now, as I said, another application of cryptography is to protect

126
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,404
正如我所说，密码学的另一个应用是用来保护

127
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:38,934
files on disk. So, here you have a file that happens to be encrypted, so that even

128
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:38,934
硬盘上的文件。现在你有一个已加密文件

129
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:43,407
if the disk is stolen, an attacker can't actually read the contents in the file.

130
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:43,407
即使你的硬盘被偷了，攻击者也不能读取硬盘中的文件内容

131
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:47,881
And, if an attacker tries to modify the data on disk, the data in the file while

132
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:47,881
如果攻击者试图修改磁盘上的数据，

133
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:52,241
it's on disk, when Alice tries to decrypt this file, that will be detected, and

134
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:52,241
当Alice试图解密文件时，改动会被检测出来

135
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:56,205
she'll then basically ignore the contents of the file. So we have both

136
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:56,205
Alice便会忽略文件内容

137
00:04:56,205 --> 00:05:00,999
confidentiality and integrity for files stored on disk. Now I want to make a minor philosophical

138
00:04:56,205 --> 00:05:00,999
所以我们能保证存在磁盘的文件的保密性和完整性，这里有一点哲学的东西

139
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:06,098
point, that in fact storing encrypted files on disk is very much the same

140
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:06,098
事实上，在硬盘上储存加密文件

141
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,872
as protecting communication between Alice and Bob. In particular, when you

142
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,872
和Alice和Bob保密通信类似。尤其是

143
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:15,379
store files on disk, it's basically Alice who stores the file today wants to read

144
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:15,379
当在磁盘上储存文件时，基本上Alice保存的是明天还要看的文件

145
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,580
the file tomorrow. So rather than communicating between two parties Alice and Bob,

146
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,580
所以与Alice和Bob两方间的通信不同

147
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,713
in the case of a stored disk encryption, it's Alice today who is

148
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,713
所以对硬盘储存文件加密的是今天的Alice

149
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:27,966
communicating with Alice tomorrow. But really the two scenarios, secure

150
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:27,966
和明天的Alice通信，但这两种情形：

151
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:32,632
communications, and secure files, are kind of philosophically the same. Now, the

152
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:32,632
安全通信和安全文件，从哲学上来说是一样的

153
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:37,001
building block for securing traffic is what's called symmetric encryption

154
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:37,001
以分组的形式保护流量的技术叫做对称式加密

155
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,666
systems. And we're gonna talk, in the first half of the course extensively about

156
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,666
在本课的第一部分，我们将详细介绍对称加密机制

157
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,035
symmetric encryption systems. So in a symmetric encryption system, basically, the two parties,

158
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,035
所以在对称加密机制中，

159
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:50,699
Alice and Bob, share a secret key k, which the attacker does not

160
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:50,699
Alice和Bob共享密钥k，攻击者不知道密钥k

161
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,069
know. Only they know the secret key k. Now, they're gonna use a cipher which

162
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,069
只有他们知道密钥k，现在他们将使用密钥安全通信

163
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,755
consists of these two algorithms, E and D. E is called an encryption algorithm and D

164
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,755
这个密钥由E算法和D算法组成，E是加密算法

165
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:04,179
is called the decryption algorithm. The encryption algorithm takes the message and

166
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:04,179
D是解密算法，加密算法把信息和密钥作为输入

167
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:08,051
the key as inputs, and produces a corresponding ciphertext. And the

168
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:08,051
并生成对应的密文

169
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:12,564
decryption algorithm does the opposite. It takes the ciphertext as input along with the key

170
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:12,564
解密算法则正好相反，它以密文和密钥作为输入

171
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:16,594
key and produces the corresponding message. Now, a very important point that

172
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:16,594
并生成相应的明文信息，这里我要强调一点

173
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:21,108
I would like to stress. I'm only gonna say this once now and never again, but it is an

174
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:21,108
尽管它非常重要，但我只说一遍，不再重复

175
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:25,467
extremely important point. And that is: that the algorithms E and D, the actual

176
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:25,467
算法E，D，是向公众

177
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:30,400
encryption algorithms are publicly known. Adversary knows exactly how they work. The

178
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:30,400
公开的加密算法。攻击者是知道算法是怎么工作的

179
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,411
only thing that's kept secret is the secret key k. Other than that

180
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,411
只有密钥k是保密的

181
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:38,880
everything else is completely public and it's really important to realize that you

182
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:38,880
其他所有东西都是公开的，明白这点很重要

183
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,080
should only use algorithms that are public because those algorithms have been

184
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,080
你应该使用公开的加密算法

185
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,685
peer-reviewed by a very large community of hundreds of people for many, many, many years,

186
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,685
因为这种算法已经由数以百计的业内人士检查了很多很多年

187
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:52,460
and these algorithms only begin to be used once this community has shown that

188
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:52,460
而且只有算法被业内证实无法破解时，这个算法才能开始被使用

189
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,952
they cannot be broken, essentially. So in fact, if somebody comes to you and says, hey, I have a proprietary

190
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,952
事实，如果有个人跟你说，我有一个私人加密方法

191
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:01,500
cipher that you might want to use, the answer usually should be that

192
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:01,500
问你要不要试试，答案通常是

193
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,162
you stick to standards, to standard algorithms, and not use a proprietary

194
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,162
坚持使用标准算法，摒弃专有算法

195
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:10,710
cipher. In fact, there are many examples of proprietary ciphers that, as soon as

196
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:10,710
实际上，有很多专有加密算法的例子

197
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,690
they were reverse engineered, they were easily broken by simple analysis.

198
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,690
一旦他们被逆向工程法分析，很容易被分析破解

199
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,716
Now, even in the simple cases of symmetric encryption which we're gonna discuss

200
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,716
现在，即使是我们在前半部分讨论的对称加密的简单情况下，

201
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:24,782
in the first half of the course, there are actually two cases that we're gonna discuss in turn.

202
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:24,782
实际上也有两种情况，我们将逐一讨论。

203
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:29,974
The first, is when every key is only used to encrypt a

204
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:29,974
第一种，每个密钥只加密一个信息

205
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:34,597
single message, we call these one time keys. Okay. So for example, when you

206
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:34,597
我们称之为一次一密，例如

207
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:39,853
encrypt email messages, it's very common that every single email is encrypted using

208
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:39,853
当你加密邮件信息时，通常不同的邮件

209
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:44,922
a different symmetric key. Yeah? Different symmetric cipher key. Because the key is

210
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:44,922
使用不同的对称密钥加密，对吧？不同的对称密钥

211
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:49,588
used to encrypt only one message there are actually fairly efficient and simple ways of

212
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:49,588
因为一个密钥只加密一个信息
所以有很多加密方法

213
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:54,090
encrypting messages using these one time keys and we'll discuss those actually

214
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:54,090
非常有效和简洁地使用一次密钥加密信息
我们将在下一模块讨论这些方法

215
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,371
in the next module. Now there are many cases in fact where keys

216
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,371
实际上，有很多时候一个密钥需要加密多个信息

217
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,488
need to be used to encrypt multiple messages. We call these many time keys.

218
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,488
我们称这些为多次密钥

219
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:06,715
For example, when you encrypt files in a file system the same key is used

220
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:06,715
例如，在一个文件系统里用同一个密钥加密很多不同的文件

221
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:11,326
to encrypt many many, different files. And it turns out if the key is now going to be used to encrypt

222
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:11,326
事实证明如果用同一个密钥加密多个信息

223
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:15,662
multiple messages we need a little bit of more machinery to make sure that the

224
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:15,662
我们需要更多的机制来确保加密系统的安全

225
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,729
encryption system is secure. In fact after we talk about the one-time keys, we

226
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,729
事实上，在我们介绍了一次一密之后

227
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,570
will move over and talk about encryption modes that are specifically designed for

228
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,570
我们还将介绍专门为多次密钥设计的加密模式

229
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,505
many-time keys. And we'll see that there are a couple more steps that need to be taken to

230
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,505
我们将会看到为了确保信息安全采取的一系列步骤

231
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:31,267
ensure security in those cases. Okay, the last point I wanna make

232
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:31,267
好了，最后说一点

233
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:35,346
is that there are a couple of important things to remember about cryptography. First of all,

234
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:35,346
关于密码学有几点很重要，首先

235
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:39,689
cryptography, of course, is a fantastic tool for protecting information in computer systems.

236
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:39,689
密码学，是用来保护计算机系统中信息的一个很有效的工具

237
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,820
However, it's also very important that cryptography has its limitations.

238
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,820
然而，同样重要的是，密码学也有它的局限性

239
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,225
First of all, cryptography is really not the solution to all security problems.

240
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,225
首先，密码学不能解决所有安全问题

241
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:52,546
For example, if you have software bugs then very often cryptography is not

242
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:52,546
例如，如果你的软件经常出现bug
那么很可能密码学就帮不了你

243
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:56,925
going to be able to help you. Similarly, if you're worried about social engineering attacks,

244
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:56,925
类似的，如果你担心受到社会工程学攻击

245
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:01,587
where the attacker tries to fool the user into taking actions

246
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:01,587
例如攻击者试图欺骗用户去做会不利于用户的事

247
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:05,966
that are going to hurt the user, then cryptography is very often actually not

248
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:05,966
那么密码学也帮不了你r(st)q

249
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:10,328
going to help you. So it's very important that although it's a fabulous tool, it's not the

250
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:10,328
尽管密码学是极好的工具

251
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:14,798
solution to all security problems. Now another very important point is that cryptography

252
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:14,798
它也解决不了所有的安全问题，另外非常重要的一点是

253
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:19,108
essentially becomes useless if it's implemented incorrectly. So, for example,

254
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:19,108
如果没有正确地使用，密码学也将变为无用。例如

255
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:23,270
there are a number of systems that work perfectly fine. And we'll see examples of those

256
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:23,270
有很多系统在正常工作，我们会看到这些系统

257
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,487
systems, that, in fact, allow Alice and Bob to communicate. And,

258
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,487
允许Alice和Bob进行通信

259
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:31,595
in fact, messages that Alice sent to Bob, Bob can receive and decrypt. However,

260
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:31,595
实际上，Alice发送信息给Bob，Bob收到信息并解密

261
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:35,776
because cryptography is implemented incorrectly, the systems are completely insecure.

262
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:35,776
但是，由于密码学被不当使用，系统实际上非常的不安全

263
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:40,537
Actually I should say that I like to mention an old encryption standard

264
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:40,537
这里我应该提及一个古老的加密标准WEP

265
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:45,240
called WEP this is used for encrypting Wi-Fi traffic. WEP contains many

266
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:45,240
WEP用来加密WiFi流量，WEP有很多的错误。

267
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,942
mistakes in it and often when I wanna show you how not to do things in cryptography

268
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,942
经常我在课上给你们演示在密码学里什么事不能做的时候

269
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:54,581
I will point to how things were done in WEP as an example. So for me, it's very fortunate to have an example,

270
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:54,581
我就会以WEP的内容为例，所以对于我来说，有这样的一个例子很幸运

271
00:09:54,581 --> 00:09:58,610
a protocol I can point to for how not to do things. And finally, a very

272
00:09:54,581 --> 00:09:58,610
一个可以指出什么不该做的案例，最后

273
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,540
important point that I'd like you to remember is that cryptography is not

274
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,540
很重要的一点请记住，密码学不是让

275
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,270
something you should try to invent and design yourself. As I said, there are

276
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,270
你自己设计发明。正如我所说

277
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,902
standards in cryptography, standard cryptographic primitives which we're gonna discuss

278
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,902
密码学有自己的标准，我们将会在这门课程中详细讨论

279
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,795
at length during this course. And primarily you're supposed to use

280
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,795
这些标准化的密码学原型。你只需要使用这些标准密码原型

281
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:17,656
these standard cryptographic primitives, and not invent things, these primitives,

282
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:17,656
不是发明它们

283
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:21,624
yourself. The standards have all gone through, many years of

284
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:21,624
这些原型已经经历了数年来人们的检测

285
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:25,860
review by hundreds of people, and that's not something that's going to happen to an ad hoc  design.

286
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:25,860
它们不是随意设计的

287
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,668
And, as I said, over the years there are many examples of

288
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,668
正如我所说，许多年来

289
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:33,797
ad hoc designs that were immediately broken as soon as they were analyzed.

290
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:33,797
许多随意设计的加密机制一经分析就立刻被破解。
