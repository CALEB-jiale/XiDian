00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
在这部分，我们会继续了解一些其他的离散概率的工具

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
In this segment, we're gonna continue with
a few more tools from discrete

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,468
我想提醒大家如果你们想在维基百科中

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,468
probability, and I want to remind everyone
that if you wanna read more about this,

5
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:11,521
了解更多关于这个工具,那么链接在这里。所以首先

6
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:11,521
there's more information in wiki books
article that is linked over here. So first

7
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:16,446
让我们快速回顾一下之前学到了哪里。我们说离散概率

8
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:16,446
let's do a quick recap of where we are. We
said that the discrete probability is

9
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:21,496
总是定义在一个有限的集合上，我们用U来表示，通常表示为这些，

10
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:21,496
always defined over a finite set, which
we're gonna denote by U, and typically for

11
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:26,671
U将成为所有N位的设置二进制字符串，指示为01N

12
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:26,671
us, U is going to be the set of all N bit
binary strings, which we denote by zero

13
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:31,534
现在的一个概率分布P在这个集合U上基本上是一个

14
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:31,534
130 N. Now a probability distribution P
over this universe U is basically a

15
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:36,834
函数，指定在区域[0,1]区间内的每一个元素，

16
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:36,834
function that assigns to every element in
the universe a weight in the interval zero

17
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:42,196
这样如果我们将所有这些元素的权重求和，会发现和就会等于一

18
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:42,196
to one, such that if we sum the weight of
all these elements, the sum basically sums

19
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:47,210
现在我们说，集合的子集是什么被称为一个事件，

20
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:47,210
up to one. Now we have said that subset of
the universe is what called an event, and

21
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,021
一个事件的概率是事件中所有元素权重的总和，

22
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,021
we said that probability of an event is
basically the sum of all the weights of

23
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:57,073
我们说，事件的概率是在

24
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:57,073
all the elements in the event and we said
that probability of an event is some real

25
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:01,764
零到一之间的实数，并且还有一点

26
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:01,764
numbers in the interval zero to one And I
would remind everyone the basically

27
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:06,575
整个集合概率一定是所有的权重和，并且等于一。

28
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:06,575
probability of the entire universe is
basically the one by the fact that sum of

29
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:11,268
然后我们定义一个正式的随机变量

30
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:11,268
all the weights sums up to one. Then we
define what a random variable is Formally,

31
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:15,908
这个随机变量是一个来自其他集合来的函数

32
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:15,908
a random variable is a, is a function from
the universe of some other sets But the

33
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:20,773
但你要记住的是，这些随机变量在集合V中所代表的含义

34
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:20,773
thing that I want you to remember is that
the random variable takes, values in some

35
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:25,289
事实上，随机变量的分布定义了这个集合V。

36
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:25,289
set v And, in fact, the random variable
defines the distribution on this set v. So

37
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:29,651
所以我们需要学习的下一个概念是什么叫做独立性，我会非常简要的定义它，

38
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:29,651
the next concept we need is what's called
independence And I'm gonna very briefly

39
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:34,278
如果你想了解更多关于独立性的内容，请去看看维基百科

40
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:34,278
define this If you want to read more about
independence, please go ahead and look at

41
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:38,374
但本质上我们说A和B这两个事件是

42
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:38,374
the wiki books article. But essentially we
say that two events A and B are

43
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:42,932
彼此独立的，如果你知道当事件A发生时，

44
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:42,932
independent of one another if When you
know that event A happens, that tells you

45
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:47,377
你不知道事件B是否发生。形式上，

46
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:47,377
nothing about whether event B actually
happened or not. Formally, the way we

47
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:52,236
我们定义独立性就是说，A和B同时发生的概率

48
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:52,236
define independence is to say that, the
probability of A and B, namely, that both

49
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:56,621
就等于事件A的概率和事件B的概率的乘积

50
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:56,621
events happened, is actually=to the
probability of event A the probability of

51
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,539
从某种意义上说，只要符合这一事实

52
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,539
event B So mult iplication, in some sense,
the fact that probabilities multiply under

53
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,339
这些事件就是独立的。就像我之前说的那样，

54
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,339
conjunction, captures the fact that these
events are independent And as I said, if

55
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:11,080
如果你想了解更多，请看背景材料。

56
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:11,080
you wanna read more about that, please
take a look at the background material.

57
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,636
现在同样的理论可以应用在随机变量上。假如我们有两个随机

58
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,636
Now the same thing can be said for random
variables. So suppose we have two random

59
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:21,921
变量X和Y。它们从集合V中取值。然后我们设这些随机

60
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:21,921
variables x and y. They take values in
some set v. Then we say that these random

61
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:26,868
变量是独立的，如果X=a和Y=b的概率

62
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:26,868
variables are independent if the
probability that x = a, and y = b is equal

63
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:32,492
等于这两个概率的乘积，基本上就是说，即使

64
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:32,492
to the product of these two probabilities.
Basically what this means is, even if you

65
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:37,606
你知道X=a的概率，你也不知道Y的值是多少。

66
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:37,606
know that x = a, that tells you nothing
about the value of y. Okay, that, that's

67
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:43,060
这意味着乘法需要知道所有A和B

68
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:43,060
what this multiplication means And again
this needs to hold for all A and B in the

69
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,185
在这些随机变量的取值空间，如果你之前看过的话

70
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,185
space of values of these random variables
So, just again to job your memory If

71
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:53,112
再加深一下印象。举个很简单的例子，我们看到这有一个

72
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:53,112
you've seen this before, a very quick
example. Suppose we look at the, set of,

73
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:58,171
两比特串的集合，00,01,10,11，

74
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:58,171
of two bit strings So, zero, zero, zero,
one, one zero and, one, one And suppose we

75
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:03,625
我们从这个集合中随机选取一个。我们随机选取这四个元素中任一个元素

76
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:03,625
choose a random, from this set. Okay so we
randomly choose one of these four elements

77
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:08,431
的概率相等。现在让我们定义两个随机变量。

78
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:08,431
with equal probability. Now let's define
two random variables. X is gonna be the

79
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:13,541
X是生成的最低有效位 即lsb(r)，Y是生成的最高有效位 即msb（r）。

80
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:13,541
least significant bit that was generated,
and Y is gonna be the most significant bit

81
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,981
然后我任命，随机变量X和Y是相互独立的。

82
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,981
generated. So I claim that, these random
variables, x and y, are independent of one

83
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:23,880
从四个元素中无差别选择r最直观的方法

84
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:23,880
another. And the way to see that
intuitively, is to realize that choosing r

85
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,440
就和抛两次硬币一样，公平的硬币两次

86
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,440
uniformly, from the set of four elements
is basically the same as flipping a coin

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,051
第一位对应第一次抛的结果和

88
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,051
An unbiased coin twice. The first bit
corresponds to the outcome of the first

89
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,517
第二位对应第二次抛的结果

90
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,517
flip and the second bit corresponds to the
outcome of the second flip And of course

91
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:43,197
当然有四种可能的结果。所有的四种结果

92
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:43,197
there are four possible outcomes. All four
outcomes are equally likely which is why

93
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:47,821
都等概率出现在这些两比特串中，现在我们的变量X和Y，

94
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:47,821
we get the uniform distributions over two
bit strings Now our variables X and Y. Y

95
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:52,557
Y是独立的，如果我告诉你抛一次的结果

96
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:52,557
the independents Basically if I tell you
result of the first flip namely I tell you

97
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:57,181
就是r，就相当于我告诉了你硬币落下来是正面还是反面

98
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:57,181
the lest signify bit of R So I tell you
how the first coin you know whether it

99
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:01,804
而第二次抛的结果什么都没有告诉你

100
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:01,804
fell on its head or fell on its tails.
That tells you nothing about the result of

101
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:06,844
这就是你的直觉，你可能期望这些随机

102
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:06,844
the second flip. Which is why intuitively,
you might, you might expect these random

103
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:11,624
变量是相互独立的，而实际上我们需要证明它。

104
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:11,624
variables to be independent of one
another. But formally, we would have to

105
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:16,142
所有的0 1对，X=0,Y=0,X=1,Y=1,的概率

106
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:16,142
prove that, for, all 01 pairs, the
probability of, x=0 and y=0, x=1, y=1, and

107
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:21,446
这些概率相乘。让我们先做其中的一个。

108
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:21,446
so on. These probabilities multiply. Let's
just do it for one of these pairs. So

109
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:26,721
看一下X=0和Y=0的概率。

110
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:26,721
let's look at the probability that x is =
to zero, and y is = to zero. Well, you see

111
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:31,027
你看X=0同时Y=0的概率应该是

112
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:31,027
that the probability that x is equal to
zero and y is equal to zero is basically

113
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:35,387
r=00的概率，然而r=00的概率是多少？

114
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:35,387
the probability that r is equal to zero,
zero And what's the probability that r is

115
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:39,535
通过均匀分布，这基本上等于四分之一

116
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:39,535
equal to zero, zero? Well, by the uniform
distribution, that's basically equal to

117
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:44,327
在这种情况下集合中的一个元素的概率就是1/4

118
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:44,327
one-fourth. What it's one over side of the
set which is one fourth in this case And

119
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:49,095
事实上这些可能的证明

120
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:49,095
well low and behold that's in fact these
probably provability multiply Because

121
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:53,583
因为再乘上了X=0的概率，即lsb（r=0）的概率

122
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:53,583
again the probability that X is equal to
zero. The probability that lest signify

123
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:57,566
这可能正是二分之一

124
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:57,566
bit of R is equal to zero. This
provability is exactly one half because

125
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:01,941
因为有两个元素他们的lsb等于零

126
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:01,941
there is exactly two elements that have
their, lest signify bit equals to zero.

127
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:06,373
四个元素证明了一半，同样的

128
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:06,373
Two out of four elements gives you a
provability of one half And similarly the

129
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,738
Y=0的概率也是二分之一。

130
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,738
probability that Y is equal to zero is
also one half so in fact the provability

131
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:16,434
我告诉你这个独立性的概念

132
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:16,434
multiplies. Okay, so that's, this concept
of independence And the reason I wanted to

133
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:21,892
是因为我们将要看一个异或重要的性质

134
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:21,892
show you that is because we're gonna look
at an, an important property of XOR that

135
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:27,349
我们将重复使用它。所以在我们讨论异或之前，让我

136
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:27,349
we're gonna use again and again. So before
we talk about XOR, let me just do a very

137
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:32,408
很快复习一下关于异或是什么。两位异或是指两个

138
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:32,408
quick review of what XOR is. So, of
course, XOR of two bits means the addition

139
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:38,065
比特相加再模2。确保每个人都在同一页上。

140
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:38,065
of those bits, modular two. So just too
kind of, make sure everybody's on the same

141
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:43,233
如果我们有两位，00,01,10,11，他们的真值表

142
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:43,233
page If we have two bits, so 0001, ten and
eleven. Their XOR or the truth table of

143
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:48,106
异或就是相加再模2。正如你所看到的，1+1=2

144
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:48,106
the XOR is basically just the addition
modular two. As you can see, one+1 is= to

145
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:52,978
再模2，就等于0.所以这就是异或的真值表

146
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:52,978
two, modular two. That's=to zero. So this
is the truth table for [inaudible] XOR And

147
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,665
我总是想通过圈的外加里来表示异或，

148
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,665
I'm always going to denote XOR by the
circle with a + inside And then when I

149
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:02,353
然后当我想异或比特串时，就按位进行相加再模2的操作

150
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:02,353
wanna apply XOR to bit strings, I apply
the, addition modular two operation,

151
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:07,472
例如，这两个字符串异或为110，

152
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:07,472
bitwise. So, for example, the XOR of these
two strings would be, 110, and I guess

153
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:12,283
我想让你填写剩下异或的结果，只是为了确保我们都在

154
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:12,283
I'll let you fill out the rest of the
XORs, just to make sure we're all on the

155
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:18,941
同一页上。它的结果为1,1,0,1，现在，我们

156
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:18,941
same page. So of course is comes out to
one, one zero one. Now, we're gonna be

157
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:23,092
会做在这堂课上做很多异或。事实上，有一个经典的笑话是

158
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:23,092
doing a lot of XORing in this class. In
fact, there's a classical joke that the

159
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:27,669
有的人认为译解密码者只是把事物异或在一起，但我想

160
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:27,669
only think cryptographers know how to do
is just XOR things together But I want to

161
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,607
向你解释为什么我们在密码学中看到如此频繁的异或。基本上，异或

162
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,607
explain to you why we see XOR so
frequently in cryptography. Basically, XOR

163
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,865
有一个很重要的性质，这性质是，假设有一个

164
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,865
has a very important property, and the
property is the following. Suppose we have

165
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:40,630
随机变量Y，任意分布在0,1区间上，所以我们

166
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:40,630
a random variable y. That's distributed
arbitrarily over 01 to the n. So we know

167
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,773
对Y的分布一无所知。但现在，假设我们有一个独立的随机

168
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,773
nothing about the distribution of y But
now, suppose we have an independent random

169
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:50,790
变量也均匀分布在0,1区间之上， 且X是均匀分布的很重要。

170
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:50,790
variable that happens to be uniformly
distributed also over 01 to the n. So it's

171
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,766
n对于Y是独立的。现在让我们来定义

172
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,766
very important that x is uniform. N's
independent of y. So now let's define the

173
00:06:55,766 --> 00:07:00,851
随机变量X和Y的异或，我认为无论

174
00:06:55,766 --> 00:07:00,851
random variable which is the XOR of x and
y. Then I claim that no matter what

175
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:05,937
Y怎么开始分布，Z总是均匀分布的随机变量。

176
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:05,937
distribution y started with, this z is
always going to be a uniform, random

177
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:11,287
换句话说，如果拿一个任意不均匀分布

178
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:11,287
variable. So in other words if I take an
arbitrarily malicious distribution and I

179
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:16,373
与一个独立均匀分布的随机变量异或最终得到的是一个均匀分布的

180
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:16,373
XOR with independent uniform random
variable what I end up with is a uniform

181
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:20,672
随机变量。这又是一个很好的性质

182
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:20,672
random variable. Okay and this again is
kind of a key property that makes x or

183
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,490
对密码学很有用。所以这是一个需要证明的非常简单的因素

184
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,490
very useful for crypto. So this is
actually a very simple factor to prove,

185
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,851
我们只需要去证明它，我们只需证明一点，n=1.

186
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,851
let's just go ahead and do it, let's just
prove it for one bit so for n = one. Okay,

187
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:33,472
我们证明它的方式是写出各种随机变量的

188
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:33,472
so the way we'll do it is we'll basically
write out the probability distributions

189
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:38,242
概率分布。所以我们会看到，对于随机变量Y，

190
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:38,242
for the various random variables. So let's
see, for the random variable y. Well, the

191
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:43,167
随机变量可以是0或1，并且那个P0是Y=0的概率，

192
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:43,167
random variable can be either zero or one.
And let's say that P0 is the probability

193
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:47,320
P1是Y=1的概率。

194
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:47,320
that it's = to zero, and P1 is the
probability that it's =to one. Okay, so

195
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,008
那就是我们的一个表格。同样的，我们会有一个变量X的表格。

196
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,008
that's one of our tables. Similarly, we're
gonna have a table for the variable x.

197
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:56,458
变量X的表格就相对容易些，X是一个均匀分布的随机变量。

198
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:56,458
Well, the variable x is much easier.
That's a uniform random variable. So the

199
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,909
X=0的概率就是二分之一，X=1的概率也是

200
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,909
probability that it's=to zero is exactly
one half The probability that's it's=to

201
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,428
二分之一。现在，让我们写出来联合分布概率。

202
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,428
one is also exactly one half. Now, let's
write out the probabilities for the join

203
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,599
换句话说，让我们先看看那不同的概率，

204
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,599
di stribution. In, in other words, let's
see what the probability, is for the

205
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,099
Y和X是联合分布概率。即Y为,0，

206
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,099
various, joint values of y and x. In other
words, how likely is, it that y is zero,

207
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,435
X为0。Y为0，X为1.Y为1，X为0，还有1 1

208
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,435
and x is zero. Y is zero, and x is one. Y
is one and x is zero, and eleven. Well, so

209
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:22,770
所以我们要做的是，因为我们假设的变量是独立的，

210
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:22,770
what we do is, basically, because we
assume the variables are independent, all

211
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,518
我们要做的就是把概率相乘。所以，Y等于0的概率

212
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,518
we have to do is multiply the
probabilities. So The probability that y

213
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:30,552
是P0，X等于0的概率是二分之一。

214
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:30,552
is equal to zero is p zero. Probability
that x is equal to zero is one-half. So

215
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:36,843
我们得到00是P0/2，同样的

216
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:36,843
the proximity that, we get 00 as exactly p
zero over two. Similarly for zero one

217
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:42,387
得到01是P0/2，得到10是P1/2,得到11

218
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:42,387
we'll get p zero over two, for one zero
we'll get p one over two And for 1-1,

219
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:47,232
是P1/2，Y=1和X=1的概率

220
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:47,232
again, the probability that y is=to one,
and x is=to one, Well, that's P1  the

221
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:52,347
是P1/2.

222
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:52,347
probability that x is=to one, which is a
half, so it's P1 over two. Okay? So those

223
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:57,664
所以这些就是X和Y各种选择可能性的四个概率。

224
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:57,664
are the four, probabilities for the
various options for x and y. So now, let's

225
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:03,182
让我们来分析一下，Z=0的概率是多少？Z=0的概率

226
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:03,182
analyze, what is the probability that z is
equal to zero? Well, the probability that

227
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:08,768
基本上相同的概率是，让我们这样写，

228
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:08,768
z is=to zero is basically the same as the
probability that, let's write it this way,

229
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:15,342
（X,Y）=(0,0)或（X,Y）=(1,1),这些都是Z=0可能出现的两种情况。

230
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:15,342
xy. Is=to 00. Or xy is=to, eleven. Those
are the two possible cases that z is=to

231
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:22,652
因为Z是X和Y的异或，这些事件是不相交的，所以，

232
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:22,652
zero Because z is the XOR of x and y. Now,
these events are disjoint, so, this

233
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:30,336
这个表达式可以写成上述两个表达式的和。

234
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:30,336
expression can simply be written as the
sum of the two expressions given above. So

235
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:37,271
基本上，这就是XY=00的概率，再加上XY=11的概率，

236
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:37,271
basically, it's the probability that xy
is=to 00, plus the probability that xy,

237
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:43,281
所以我们可以简单地在表中找一下这些概率。

238
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:43,281
is=to eleven. So now we can simply look up
these probabilities in our table. So the

239
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:47,874
所以XY=00的概率是P0/2，

240
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:47,874
probability that xy is equal to 00 is
simply p zero over two, and the

241
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:53,156
XY=11的概率是P1/2.所以我们得到

242
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:53,156
probability that xy is equal to one, one
is simply p one over two. So we get P0

243
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:58,818
P0/2+P1/2,但是我们怎么知道P0和P1呢？

244
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:58,818
over two +P1 over two But what do we kn-,
what do we know about P0 and P1? Well,

245
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:03,819
这是一个概率分布，因此，P0+P1＝１。因此，

246
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:03,819
it's a probability distribution.
Therefore, P0+P1 must =one And therefore,

247
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:09,482
这个部分一定等于一半，P0+P1=1。所以，

248
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:09,482
this fraction here must= to a half. P0+P1
is =to one. So therefore, the sum of these

249
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:15,292
两个部分的和一定等于一半，这样就完成了。基本上我们证明

250
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:15,292
two terms must = a half And we're done.
Basically, we proved that the probability

251
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:20,143
了Z=0的概率是二分之一，然而Z=1的概率

252
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:20,143
that z is = to zero. Is one half,
therefore the probability that z is equal

253
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:25,123
也是二分之一。因此，Z是一个均匀分布的随机变量

254
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:25,123
to one is also one half. Therefore z is a
unif orm random variable. So the simple

255
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:29,773
这个定理如此简单的原因是XOR在密码学上非常有用。我想告诉你

256
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:29,773
theorem is the main reason why x o is so
useful in cryptography. The last thing I

257
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:34,437
最后一件事就是关于一个叫做生日悖论的离散概率

258
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:34,437
wanna show you about discreet probability
is what's called the birthday paradox And

259
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:38,934
在这里我会说很快，因为我们以后会回来

260
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:38,934
I'm gonna do it really fast here Because
we're gonna come back later on, and talk

261
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:42,931
详细的讨论它。生日悖论就是下面

262
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:42,931
about this in more detail. So, the
birthday paradox says the following

263
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:47,370
假设我在区域U中选择n个随机变量，碰巧的是，

264
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:47,370
suppose I choose n random variables in our
universe u. Okay And it just so happens

265
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,485
这些变量是相互独立的，他们其实不必相同。

266
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,485
that these variables are independent of
one another. They actually don't have to

267
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,651
我们需要假设的是，他们分布的方式相同。

268
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,651
be uniform. All we need to assume is that
they're distributed in the same way. The

269
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:59,818
最重要的性质是他们是相互独立的。所以定理说，

270
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:59,818
most important property though is that
they're independent of one another. So the

271
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:04,035
如果你选择元素U大小的平方根，

272
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:04,035
theorem says that if you choose roughly
the square root of the size of u elements,

273
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:08,202
这里有一个1.2，没关系，但如果你选择

274
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:08,202
we're kind of this one point two here, it
doesn't really matter. But if you choose

275
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:12,471
元素U绝对值的平方根，有一个很大的概率会有

276
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:12,471
square root of the size of u elements,
then basically there's a good chance that

277
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,740
两个元素是相同的。换句话说，如果你把样本

278
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,740
there are two elements that are the same.
In other words, if you sample about square

279
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,158
平方根几次，那么很有可能你的两个样本不会

280
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,158
root a few times, then it's likely that
two of your samples. [inaudible] will be

281
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:25,763
相等。顺便指出，这个反向的E

282
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:25,763
equal to each other. And by the way, I
should point out that this inverted e,

283
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:30,860
的含义是存在。所以存在i不等于j并且ri=rj,

284
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:30,860
just means exists. So there exists in
[inaudible] I and j such that r I is equal

285
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,057
这是一个具体的例子，我们会看到很多次。

286
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,057
to r j. So here's a concrete example.
We'll actually see many, many times.

287
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:39,493
假设我们的区域由128位长度的字符串构成，

288
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:39,493
Suppose our universe consist of all
strings of length of one hundred and

289
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:44,279
所以U的大小其实是2的128次方，

290
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:44,279
twenty eight bits. So the size of you is
gigantic it's actually two to the hundred

291
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,123
它非常大，但是碰巧如果你从这个集合中

292
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,123
and twenty eight. It's a very, very large
set But it so happens if you sample say

293
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:53,909
取样取了2的64次方次，这是关于U的平方根

294
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:53,909
around two the sixty four times from the
set. This is about the square root of U

295
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:58,520
那么很有可能你的两个样本信息实际上是相同的。

296
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:58,520
then is very likely that two of your
sample messages will actually be the same.

297
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,871
所以为什么这叫做悖论？通常它用来描述

298
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,871
So why is, this called the paradox? Well,
traditionally it's described in terms of

299
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:06,896
人们的生日，所以你会认为这些样本是

300
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:06,896
people's birthdays. So you would think
that each of these samples would be

301
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:11,772
某些人的生日，所以问题是多少人需要在一起以至于

302
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:11,772
someone's birthday And so the question is
how many people need to get together so

303
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,510
有两个人的生日是相同的？所以，做一个简单的计算，

304
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,510
that there are two people that have the
same birthday? So, just as a simple cal

305
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,349
你会看到一年有365天，你需要大约1.2倍的

306
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,349
culation you can see there are 365 days in
the year, so you would need about 1.2

307
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:26,656
的365人的平方根，直到其中两人生日相同的

308
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:26,656
times the square root of 365 people until
the probability that two of them have the

309
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:31,327
概率超过一半。这个如果我没记错的话大概是24，这意味着

310
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:31,327
same birthday is more than a half. This if
I'm not mistaken is about 24, which means

311
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:35,673
如果24个随机的人呆在一间屋子里，很有可能其中会有两个人

312
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:35,673
that if 24 random people get together in a
room it's very likely that two of them

313
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:40,020
有相同的生日。这就是为什么它被称为一个悖论，因为24

314
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:40,020
will actually have the same birthday. This
is why it's called a paradox, because 24

315
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,457
可能是一个比你想象的要小的数字。有趣的是，人们的

316
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,457
supposedly is a smaller number than you
would expect. Interestingly, people's

317
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:50,401
生日其实不是均衡的分布在一年的365天，实际上

318
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:50,401
birthdays are not actually uniform across
all 365 days of the year. There's actually

319
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:55,223
更偏向于十二月。但是我认为没有必要

320
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:55,223
a bias towards December. >> But, I guess
that's not, that's not relative to the

321
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:59,878
在这里讨论这个。我想做的最后一件事是给你看

322
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:59,878
discussion here. >> The last thing I
wanted to do is just show you the birthday

323
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:04,533
更具体的生日悖论。假设我们有一个大约一百万样本的

324
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:04,533
paradox a bit more concretely. So, suppose
we have a universe of about a million

325
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,244
区域，那么你可以看到，当我们的取样大约1200次的时候，

326
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,244
samples, then you can see that when we
sample roughly 1200 times, the probability

327
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,197
我们有一半的概率在其中两次取样中取到了相同的元素

328
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,197
that we get, we sample the same number,
the same element twice is roughly half But

329
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:18,498
但是两次抽样相同数的概率其实非常快的收敛到了一。

330
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:18,498
the probability of sampling the same
number twice actually converges very

331
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:22,857
你可以看到如果我们有2200个样本，然后这些物品中

332
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:22,857
quickly to one. You can see that if we
about 2200 items, then the probability

333
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:26,790
两个取样相同的概率已经是90%，你知道，如果是3000

334
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:26,790
that two of those items are the same,
already is 90 percent and You know, 3000

335
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,440
的话，概率基本上是一。所以一旦超越了U大小的平方根，

336
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,440
then it's basically one. So this
conversion is very quickly to one as soon

337
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,484
这个变化非常快的收敛到一。所以我们以后会

338
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,484
as he goes beyond the square root of the
size of the universe. So we're gonna come

339
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:38,380
回来更详细的研究生日悖论，但我现在只想

340
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:38,380
back and study the birthday paradox in
more detail later on, but I just for now,

341
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,597
让你知道它是什么。所以这节就结束了，

342
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,597
wanted you to know what it is. So that's
the end of this segment, and then in the

343
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:49,509
在下一节我们将开始加密系统的第一个例子。

344
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:49,509
next segment we'll start with our first
example of encryption systems. [sound]
