1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:03,017
In the last segment, we saw two active
attacks that can completely destroy the

2
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:03,017
上一节我们看了两个可以完全破坏CPA安全加密的安全性的主动攻击

3
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:08,354
security of CPA secure encryption. In this
segment, we're gonna define a new concept,

4
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:08,354
本节课我们将定义一个新概念

5
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:12,183
called authenticated encryption, that
remains secure in the presence of an

6
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:12,183
叫做认证加密 即对主动攻击者也能保持安全

7
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:16,978
active adversary. In later segments, we'll
construct encryption schemes that satisfy

8
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:16,978
在后面几节 我们将组建满足这个认证加密新概念的加密机制

9
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:21,007
this new authenticated encryption concept.
So what is authenticated encryption?

10
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:21,007
那什么是认证加密呢？

11
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:25,866
Authenticated encryption is a cipher where
as usual the encryption algorithm takes a

12
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:25,866
认证加密是一个密码 通常是个加密算法

13
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:31,234
key, a message and optionally a nonce and outputs
a cipher text. The decryption algorithm as

14
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:31,234
取密钥 信息和一个可选择的临时值作为输入 输出一个密文

15
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:35,795
usual outputs a message. However, here the
decryption algorithm is allowed to output

16
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:35,795
解密算法通常输出一个信息 但是这个解密算法可以输出一个特殊符号

17
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:40,594
a special symbol called bottom. When the
decryption algorithm outputs the symbol

18
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:40,594
叫做⊥ 当解密算法输出符号⊥时

19
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,887
bottom, basically it says that the cipher
text is invalid and should be ignored. The

20
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,887
密文是无效的 而且应当被忽略

21
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:49,198
only requirement is that this bottom is
not in the message space so that in fact

22
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:49,198
唯一的要求是这个⊥不属于信息空间

23
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:53,655
it is a unique symbol that indicates that
the cipher text should be rejected. Now

24
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:53,655
那么⊥就是唯一一个表示密文应当被拒绝的符号

25
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:57,175
what does it mean for an authenticated
encryption system to be secure? Well the

26
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:57,175
那一个认证加密系统是安全的是什么概念呢

27
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:00,774
system has to satisfy two properties. The
first property is that it has to be

28
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:00,774
这个系统必须满足两个性质 第一个性质是

29
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:05,035
semantically secure under a chosen
plaintext attack just as before. But now

30
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:05,035
它必须像之前一样对选择明文攻击是语义安全的

31
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:08,881
there's a second property which says that
the system also has to satisfy what's

32
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:08,881
第二个性质是这个系统必须满足密文完整性

33
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:13,063
called cipher text integrity. What that
means is that even though the attacker

34
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:13,063
这意味着尽管攻击者

35
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:17,145
gets to see a number of cipher texts, it
should not be able to produce another

36
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:17,145
能看到一些密文 他也不能生成另一个能被正确解密的密文

37
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:21,360
cipher text that decrypts properly. In
other words, that decrypts to something

38
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:21,360
换句话说 密文会被解密成其他非符号⊥的东西

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,813
other than bottom. More precisely,
let's look at the ciphertext integrity game.

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,813
更精确地的说 让我们来看一下这个密文完整性游戏

41
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:30,923
So here, (E,D) is a cipher with message
space M. As usual, the challenger begins

42
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:30,923
这里（E,D）是一个信息空间M上的密码 通常挑战者开始时

43
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:35,635
by choosing a random key K. And
the adversary can submit messages of his

44
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:35,635
选择一个随机密钥K 攻击者可以提交他选择的信息

45
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:40,229
choice, and receive the encryptions of
those messages. So here, C1 is the

46
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:40,229
之后收到这些信息的加密

47
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,617
encryption of M1, where M1 was chosen by
the adversary. And the adversary can do

48
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,617
这里C1是由攻击者选择的M1的加密

49
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:47,677
this repeatedly. In other words, he
submits M2 and obtains the encryption of

50
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:47,677
攻击者可以反复执行这个操作 换句话说 攻击者提交M2并得到M2的加密结果  等等

51
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:52,867
M2, and so on and so forth. He submits
many more messages up until Mq and obtains

52
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:52,867
他提交更多的信息直到Mq为止

53
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:58,499
the encryption of all those messages. So
here the adversary obtained Q cipher texts

54
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:58,499
然后获得了所有这些信息的加密结果 那么攻击者获得了q个他选择的信息的密文

55
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:03,851
for messages of his choice. Then his goal
is to produce some new cipher text that's

56
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:03,851
他的目标是产生某个新的有效密文

57
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:08,883
valid. So we'll say that the adversary
wins the game if basically this new cipher

58
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:08,883
如果这个攻击者产生的新密文被正确地解密了

59
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:12,820
text that the adversary created decrypts
correctly, in other words decrypts to

60
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:12,820
换句话说被解密成了非符号⊥的东西

61
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,507
something other than bottom. And it's a
new cipher text. In other words, it's not

62
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,507
我们就说这个攻击者赢了 它是某个新密文

63
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:20,722
one of the cipher texts that was given to
the adversary as part of this chosen

64
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:20,722
换句话说 它不是选择明文攻击中给攻击者的密文之一

65
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:24,499
plaintext attack. And then as usual we
defined the adversary's advantage in the

66
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:24,499
在这个密文完整性游戏中我们通常

67
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:28,963
cipher text integrity game as the
probability that the challenger outputs

68
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:28,963
将攻击者的优势定义为挑战者在游戏最后输出1的概率

69
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:32,787
one at the end of the game and we'll say
that the cipher has cipher text integrity

70
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:32,787
如果事实上对所有的有效攻击者

71
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:37,754
if in fact for all efficient adversaries
the advantage in winning this game is

72
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:37,754
其赢得游戏的优势都是可忽略的
我们就说这个密码具有密文完整性

73
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:41,615
negligible. So now that we understand
what cipher text integrity is we can

74
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:41,615
现在知道了什么是密文完整性 我们就可以定义

75
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:45,090
define authenticated encryption and
basically we say that the cipher has

76
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:45,090
认证加密 如果一个密码在选择明文攻击下是语义安全的

77
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,787
authenticated encryption if as we said
it's semantically secure under a chosen

78
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,787
同时也具有密文完整性

79
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:54,304
plaintext attack and it also has cipher
text integrity. So just as a bad example,

80
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:54,304
那么我们就说这个密码有认证加密 举一个不好的例子

81
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:59,456
let me mention that CBC with a random IV
does not provide authenticated encryption

82
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:59,456
带随机IV的CBC是不能提供认证加密的

83
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,812
because it's very easy for the adversary
to win the cipher text integrity game.

84
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,812
因为这将使攻击者很容易赢得密文完整性游戏

85
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:07,080
The adversary simply submits a random cipher text

86
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:07,080
攻击者只用提交一个随机的密文

87
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,375
and since the decryption algorithm for
CBC encryption never outputs bottom,

88
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,375
又因为CBC的解密算法永远不会输出⊥

89
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,941
it always outputs some message,
the adversary just easily wins the game.

90
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,941
它总会输出一下信息 攻击者就很容易赢得游戏

91
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:18,883
Any old random cipher text will decrypt
to something other than bottom

92
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:18,883
任何旧的随机密文会被解密成某些不是⊥的东西

93
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:23,110
and therefore the adversary directly wins
the cipher-text integrity game. So this is just

94
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:23,110
所以攻击者直接赢得了密文完整性游戏 这只是一个

95
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,686
a trivial example of a CPA secure cipher that
does not provide authenticated encryption.

96
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,686
不提供认证加密的CPA安全密码的简单例子

97
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:32,755
So I wanna mention two implications of
authenticated encryption. The first I'll

98
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:32,755
我想说两点有关认证加密的含义 第一点

99
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:37,347
call authenticity, which means that,
basically, an attacker cannot fool the

100
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:37,347
真实性 这意味着一个攻击者不能够欺骗接收者Bob

101
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:42,026
recipient, Bob, into thinking that Alice
sent a certain message that she didn't

102
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:42,026
让他认为Alice发送了一条她根本没有发送的确定的信息

103
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:46,154
actually send. So let's see what I mean by
that. Well, here, the attacker basically

104
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:46,154
让我们看一下这是什么意思 攻击者与

105
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:50,762
gets to interact with Alice, and get her
to encrypt arbitrary messages of his

106
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:50,762
Alice取得联系 让Alice加密任意一条他所选择的信息

107
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:56,516
choice. So this is a chosen plain text
attack. And then the attacker's goal is to

108
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:56,516
这是一个选择明文攻击 攻击者的目标就是

109
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:01,882
produce some cipher text that was not
actually created by Alice. And because the

110
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:01,882
生成一些并不是由Alice创建的密文 又因为

111
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:06,213
attacker can't win the cipher text
integrity game, he can't do this. What

112
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:06,213
攻击者不能够赢得密文完整性的游戏 他就不能做到这一点

113
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,914
this means is, when Bob receives the
cipher text that decrypts correctly under

114
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,914
这就是说 当Bob收到由解密算法正确解密的密文时

115
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:14,570
the decryption algorithm, he knows that
the message must have come from someone

116
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:14,570
他知道这个消息一定来自于一个知道

117
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,317
who knows the secret key K. In particular,
if Alice is the only one who knows K, then

118
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,317
密钥K的人 尤其是如果Alice是唯一一个知道密钥K的人

119
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:23,325
he knows the cipher text really did come
from Alice, and it's not some modification

120
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:23,325
那么他就知道密文确实是来源于Alice 并不是攻击者发送的某些修改

121
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:28,307
that was sent by the attacker. Now the
only caveat to that is that authenticated

122
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:28,307
唯一的注意的是

123
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:32,099
encryption doesn't defend against replay
attacks. In particular, the attacker

124
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:32,099
加密认证并不能抵御重放攻击 尤其是当攻击者

125
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:36,214
could've intercepted some cipher text from
Alice to Bob. And could have replayed it

126
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:36,214
可以截取由Alice发给Bob的密文时 他可以将信息重放

127
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:40,762
and both cipher text would look valid to
Bob. So for example, Alice might send a

128
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:40,762
这使得两个信息对于Bob来说都是有效的 例如Alice可能发一条信息

129
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:46,915
message to Bob saying transfer $100 to
Charlie. Then Charlie could replay that

130
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:46,915
给Bob让他转100$给Charlie Charlie可以重放出这条信息

131
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:51,498
cipher text and as a result, Bob would
transfer another $100 to Charlie. So in

132
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:51,498
结果就是Bob再转100$给Charlie

133
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:55,419
fact, any encryption protocol has to
defend against replay attacks and this is

134
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:55,419
事实上 任何一个加密协议都必须抵御重放攻击

135
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,342
not something that's directly prevented by
authenticated encryption. And we'll come

136
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,342
而这是被认证加密直接避免的

137
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:02,930
back and talk about replay attacks in two
segments. The second implication of

138
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:02,930
接下来两节我们会回来讨论重放攻击 认证加密的第二个含义是

139
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,987
authenticated encryption is that it
defends against a very powerful type of

140
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,987
它能抵御十分强大的攻击者

141
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:11,480
adversary, namely an adversary that can
mount what's called a chosen cipher text

142
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:11,480
例如可以运用所谓选择密文攻击的攻击者

143
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,933
attack. We're going to talk about that
actually in the next segment.

144
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,933
我们将在下节来讨论这个
