1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
到了这个六周课程的最后了 在教这门课的过程中我得到了

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
This brings us to the end of the six weeks
course. I had a lot of fun teaching this

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,566
很多乐趣，希望你们也能享受这门课 我十分喜欢这个内容

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,566
course and I hope you enjoyed it too. I
really love this material and I always

5
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:11,232
而且我总是喜欢教授它们 在我们告别之前 让我们快速

6
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:11,232
enjoy teaching it. Before we say our
farewells, please do a quick review of the

7
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:15,166
复习一下我们讨论的课题 也研究一下剩下的课题 这里是一个简单的

8
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:15,166
topics that we discussed and see what's
left to cover. So here's a brief diagram

9
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,411
我们在这门课上所讨论的密码学原件的框图 第一周

10
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,411
of the primitive that we discussed in the
class. If you remember in week one we

11
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,762
我们从伪随机数生成器和流密码谈起 第二周

12
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,762
started off by discussing pseudorandom
generators and stream ciphers. In week two

13
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:28,168
我们讨论了有关分组密码 我们说到考虑分组密码的

14
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:28,168
we talked about block ciphers and we said
that the right way to think about block

15
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:32,734
正确方式是考虑伪随机置换和伪随机函数 我们提到使用

16
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:32,734
cipher is as pseudorandom permutations and
pseudorandom functions. We said that using

17
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:37,301
counter mode we can convert a block cipher
into a PRG. And we said that using the GGM

18
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:37,301
计数器模式可以把一个分组密码编程一个PRG 我们说用GGM

19
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:41,375
construction. We can construct block
ciphers from pseudorandom generators. Then

20
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:41,375
构造 我们可以从伪随机数生成器构造分组密码 接着

21
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,271
第三周 我们讨论了有关数据完整性 特别的 我们讨论了

22
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,271
in week three, we talked about data
integrity. In particular, we talked about

23
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,906
MAC 我们研究了利用伪随机函数构造MAC的各种方式

24
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,906
MACs and we looked at various
constructions of MACs from pseudorandom

25
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,749
比如CMAC HMAC 和PMAC等等 我们也讨论了

26
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,749
functions like the CMAC, the HMAC, the
PMAC constructions and so on. We also

27
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:57,164
防碰撞 我们说到防碰撞性质可以用来获得

28
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:57,164
discussed collision resistance and we said
that collision resistance can be used for

29
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:01,111
制度存储中需要的数据完整性 基本上 你可以

30
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:01,111
data integrity where one has access to
read-only memory. Basically, you would

31
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,110
利用碰撞稳固的杂凑函数对数据进行杂凑 把杂凑值

32
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,110
hash the data using a collision resistance
hash function; write the hash into

33
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,369
写到只读的存储里 接着 当你希望验证数据的认证性是

34
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,369
read-only memory. And then later, when you
want to verify authenticity of your data,

35
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,633
你就把数据的杂凑值与写入只读存储的杂凑值进行比较 接着

36
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,633
you just compare its hash to whatever is
written in read-only memory. Then in week 4

37
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:17,943
第四周 我们讨论了如何把完整性和保密性结合起来 特别的

38
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:17,943
we talked about how to combine integrity
and confidentiality, in particular we

39
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:22,640
我们谈到了把加密和MAC结合起来构造我们所谓的

40
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:22,640
kinda talk about to combine encryption and
MACs to build what we called Authenticated

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,951
认证加密 我告诉你们在实际中 最重要的对称密码

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,951
Encryption and I told you that really in
practice, the only foremost Symmetric

43
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:31,151
你能用的就是认证加密 基本上

44
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:31,151
Encryption that you're allowed to use is
Authenticated Encryption. Basically,

45
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:35,461
encryption that's only secure against
eavesdropping attacks is not generally

46
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:35,461
只能抵抗窃听攻击的加密并不安全

47
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,827
secure, you must always also guard against
tampering and as a result, you should only

48
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,827
你必须能够抵抗篡改 于是 你只能用

49
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:44,388
be using Authenticated Encryption modes to
do Symmetric Encryption. So that was the

50
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:44,388
认证加密模式做对称加密 我们后面变换了课题讨论了

51
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:48,574
end of week four. And then for weeks five
and six, we switched topics and talked

52
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:48,574
密钥交换和公钥加密 特别的 第五周

53
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:52,759
about key exchange and public key encryption.
In particular, in week five we talked

54
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:52,759
我们讨论了陷门函数和Diffie Hellman协议

55
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,247
about Trapdoor Functions and the
Diffie-Hellman Protocol [within??] the

56
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,247
也讨论了有关的数学课题以解释这些是怎么工作的

57
00:01:56,247 --> 00:02:00,594
Mathematics that are necessary to explain
how those things work. And then in week

58
00:01:56,247 --> 00:02:00,594
第六周我们讨论了如何从陷门函数构造公钥加密和

59
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:05,048
six we talked about how public key encryption
can be built from trapdoor functions and,

60
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:05,048
Diffie-Hellman协议 我想重点提一下

61
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:09,090
the Diffie-Hellman Protocol. I wanna
emphasize that the key exchange protocols

62
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:09,090
第五周我们看到的密钥交换协议只能防止窃听攻击而永远

63
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,573
that we saw in week five are only secure
against eavesdropping and should never be

64
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,573
不应该在现实中使用 实际上 第8周我们会看到认证的密钥交换

65
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:18,002
used in practice. In fact in week eight
we're gonna see authenticated key exchange

66
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:18,002
协议 那些协议才能在实际中应用 比如

67
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:22,485
protocols and those are the ones that are
actually used in the wild for example in

68
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:22,485
SSL协议和类似的协议 但是第五周我们看到的协议

69
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:26,698
SSL and other protocols like that. But,
the ones that we saw in week five should

70
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:26,698
就永远不要在真实应用中用 我们研究这些简单密钥

71
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:31,018
never actually be deployed in the real
world. The only reason we looked at those

72
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:31,018
交换体制的原因是作为陷门函数和

73
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:35,123
simple key exchange mechanisms was as
motivation for trapdoor functions and

74
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:35,123
Diffie-Hellman群的例子 现在你这道了我们后面还有四周

75
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:39,064
Diffie-Hellman groups. Now as you know there
are four more weeks to the full crypto

76
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:39,064
的课以完成整个密码学学习。第七周我们会讨论有关

77
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:42,934
course which we're gonna do at a later
time. In week seven we're gonna talk about

78
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:42,934
数字签名和验证数据的方式，这种方式使得任何人都可以

79
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,996
digital signatures and how to authenticate
data in a way that anyone can verify that

80
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,996
验证数据的来源 接着我们会讨论认证的密钥交换

81
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:50,866
the data is authentic. Then we're gonna
talk about authenticated key exchanges as

82
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:50,866
如我前面所说我们会讨论用户认证性 如何管理口令

83
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,640
I said then we're gonna talk about user
authentication, how to manage passwords,

84
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,640
一次性口令 挑战相应协议 接着我们会讨论

85
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,319
one time passwords, challenge-response
protocols. Then we'll talk about various

86
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,319
各种各样的隐私机制 如何证实你是你自己但是却不泄露你是谁

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,190
privacy mechanisms. How to authenticate
yourself without revealing where you are,

88
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,190
如何在不泄露你自己身份的情况下签名等等 在那个部分

89
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,284
How to sign in a way it doesn't reveal who
you are and so on and so forth. And in this part

90
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,284
为了构造某种功能块 实际上我们会讨论

91
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:10,041
of the building blocks for some of these
mechanisms, actually, we'll talk about

92
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:10,041
零知识证明 它是在密码学中广泛使用的达到常用目的一种工具

93
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,992
zero-knowledge protocols which is kind of
a general purpose tool that's used very

94
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,992
但是 我们说 密码学比这些个核心课题要

95
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:17,821
widely in cryptography. But let's just say
that crypto goes way beyond this core

96
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:17,821
深远得多 实际上 有很多很多课题我很希望跟大家

97
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:21,687
topics and in fact, there are many, many
more topics that I would love to tell you

98
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:21,687
说说 如果时间够的话 所以我这里做了这么一个短短的列表 

99
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:25,554
about if there was enough time. So I made
this kind of a short list here and this isn't

100
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:25,554
这都不全面 有太多的东西需要讲了

101
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:29,469
even an exhaustive list. There are many
other things that I would like to tell you

102
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:29,469
如果有需求 我可能会再做一个进阶的密码学课程

103
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:33,383
about and so if there's enough demand, I
might even run an advanced crypto class

104
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:33,383
一般我是给研究生做的，能够覆盖这些

105
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:37,107
which is usually what I do for graduate
students which would cover these more

106
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:37,107
进一步的课题 实际上有可能明年什么时候就可以了

107
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:40,831
advanced topics but that would actually
take place sometime next year so stay

108
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:40,831
所以，请大家关注 我会在开始的时候发通知 所以 我最后要说的

109
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:44,890
tuned and I will send announcements on
when that's coming. So my final words of

110
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:44,890
关于这个课程的是 记住我这门课的主要观点 密码学是强大

111
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,427
course remember my main message from this
class. And that crypto is a tremendous

112
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,427
的工具 但是你用的时候一定要消息 如果你使用

113
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:53,298
tool but you should always be careful when
you use it. If you implement crypto

114
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:53,298
不当 系统能好好工作 但是

115
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:56,821
incorrectly, the system will work
perfectly fine. It would be no way to

116
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:56,821
除非有攻击者试图攻击你的系统 你是不会知道它是不安全的

117
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:00,791
tell that anything is wrong except when
attacker is trying to attack the system,

118
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:00,791
可能很容易就被攻破了 因此密码学是这样一种科学

119
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,571
it might be easily breakable. And so
crypto is one of these things where a

120
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,571
你了解不够就非常危险 确保你正确地使用密码学

121
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:08,317
little bit of knowledge is quite
dangerous. It's quite important to make

122
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:08,317
是非常重要的 而这么做的方法就是确保

123
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:12,531
sure you get the implementation correctly
and one way to do that is to make sure

124
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:12,531
总有人帮你查看你密码应用的代码和设计 找出所有的bug

125
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:16,850
that always other people review your code
and your designs to find any bugs in the

126
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:16,850
甚至系统设计中一般的bug 最后 

127
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,116
crypto implementation or even more general
bugs in the system design. And finally

128
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,116
我还有把这句话留给大家 永远不要发明自己的

129
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:25,313
I'll leave you with these parting words, that you should never ever invent your own

130
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:25,313
密码或者你自己的模式 你也永远不要应用自己的密码和

131
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:29,454
ciphers or your own modes and you should
never even implement your own ciphers or

132
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:29,454
模式 尽可能全部使用标准 尽量

133
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:33,242
your own modes. Try to stick to the
standards as much as possible. Try to

134
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:33,242
使用标准算法应用 如果你

135
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:37,535
stick to standard implementations of those
algorithms as much as possible and if you

136
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:37,535
不得不脱离标准 那就确保有充足的第三方审核你

137
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:41,778
have to deviate from that, then just make
sure there's sufficient third party review

138
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:41,778
的工作 好 在这儿我该说再见了 一般

139
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:46,557
of what you've done. Okay, so I will
say my farewell here. And let me say that

140
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:46,557
期末考试会在第七周 就是第六周

141
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:50,956
the final exam will be made available on
week seven, basically, a week after the

142
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:50,956
